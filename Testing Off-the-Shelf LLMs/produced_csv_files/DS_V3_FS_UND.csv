While it specifies the subject (actual evapotranspiration rate) and the geographic context (range of Spermophilus major), it lacks several key details that would make it fully specified. For instance, it does not specify the time frame (e.g., annual, seasonal, or monthly rates), the spatial resolution (e.g., average over the entire range or specific regions), or the source of the data (e.g., satellite-derived, modeled, or ground measurements). Additionally, the term 'actual evapotranspiration rate' could refer to different methodologies or definitions, which are not clarified. Therefore, the query is underspecified."",
