{"question":"what stage of the star life cycle is the sun in","short_answers":["about halfway through its main-sequence stage"],"long_answer":" The Sun is about halfway through its main - sequence stage , during which nuclear fusion reactions in its core fuse hydrogen into helium . Each second , more than four million tonnes of matter are converted into energy within the Sun 's core , producing neutrinos and solar radiation . At this rate , the Sun has so far converted around 100 times the mass of Earth into energy , about 0.03 % of the total mass of the Sun . The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 billion years as a main - sequence star . The Sun is gradually becoming hotter during its time on the main sequence , because the helium atoms in the core occupy less volume than the hydrogen atoms that were fused . The core is therefore shrinking , allowing the outer layers of the Sun to move closer to the centre and experience a stronger gravitational force , according to the inverse - square law . This stronger force increases the pressure on the core , which is resisted by a gradual increase in the rate at which fusion occurs . This process speeds up as the core gradually becomes denser . It is estimated that the Sun has become 30 % brighter in the last 4.5 billion years . At present , it is increasing in brightness by about 1 % every 100 million years .

{"question":"when did they stop cigarette advertising on television","short_answers":["January 2, 1971"],"long_answer":" After World War II , cigarette companies advertised frequently on television programs . To combat this move by the cigarette companies , the Federal Communications Commission required television stations to air anti-smoking advertisements at no cost to the organizations providing such advertisements . In 1970 , Congress took their anti-smoking initiative one step further and passed the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act , banning the advertising of cigarettes on television and radio starting on January 2 , 1971 . After the television ban , most cigarette advertising took place in magazines , newspapers , and on billboards . However , in 1999 all cigarette billboard advertisements were replaced with anti-smoking messages , with some of these anti-smoking messages playing parodies of cigarette companies advertising figures and slogans . Since 1984 , cigarette companies have also been forced to place Surgeon 's General warnings on all cigarette packs and advertisements because of the passing of the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act . Restrictions on cigarette companies became even tighter in 2010 with the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act . The act prohibits tobacco companies from sponsoring sports , music , and other cultural events and also prevents the display of their logos or products on T - shirts , hats , or other apparel .

{"question":"who discovered that neural communication between cells occurs through chemicals","short_answers":["Charles Sherrington"],"long_answer":" Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal proposed that neurons are not continuous throughout the body , yet still communicate with each other , an idea known as the neuron doctrine . The word `` synapse '' -- from the Greek synapsis ( \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03ac\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2 ) , meaning `` conjunction '' , in turn from \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03ac\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u1f76\u03bd ( \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd ( `` together '' ) and \u1f05\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ( `` to fasten '' ) ) -- was introduced in 1897 by the English neurophysiologist Charles Sherrington in Michael Foster 's Textbook of Physiology . Sherrington struggled to find a good term that emphasized a union between two separate elements , and the actual term `` synapse '' was suggested by the English classical scholar Arthur Woollgar Verrall , a friend of Michael Foster . Some authors generalize the concept of the synapse to include the communication from a neuron to any other cell type , such as to a motor cell , although such non-neuronal contacts may be referred to as junctions ( a historically older term ) .

{"question":"where is the oldest civilization known to man","short_answers":["Mesopotamia"],"long_answer":" Around 10,200 BC the first fully developed Neolithic cultures belonging to the phases Pre-Pottery Neolithic A ( PPNA ) and Pre-Pottery Neolithic B ( 7600 to 6000 BC ) appeared in the fertile crescent and from there spread eastwards and westwards . One of the most notable PPNA settlements is Jericho in the Levant region , thought to be the world 's first town ( settled around 8500 BC and fortified around 6800 BC ) . In Mesopotamia , the convergence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers produced rich fertile soil and a supply of water for irrigation . The civilizations that emerged around these rivers are among the earliest known non-nomadic agrarian societies . It is because of this that the fertile crescent region , and Mesopotamia in particular , are often referred to as the cradle of civilization . The period known as the Ubaid period ( c. 6500 to 3800 BC ) is the earliest known period on the alluvial plain , although it is likely earlier periods exist obscured under the alluvium . It was during the Ubaid period that the movement towards urbanization began . Agriculture and animal husbandry were widely practiced in sedentary communities , particularly in Northern Mesopotamia , and intensive irrigated hydraulic agriculture began to be practiced in the south . Eridu is the oldest Sumerian site settled during this period , around 5300 BC , and the city of Ur also first dates to the end of this period . In the south , the Ubaid period had a very long duration from around 6500 to 3800 BC ; when it is replaced by the Uruk period .

{"question":"the taj mahal served as an example of aesthetic value for this kind of function","short_answers":["the paradise garden (charbagh)"],"long_answer":" The concept of the paradise garden ( charbagh ) was brought from Persia by the Mughals as a form of Timurid garden . They were the first architectural expression the new empire made in the Indian sub-continent , and fulfilled diverse functions with strong symbolic meanings . The symbolism of these gardens is derived from mystic Islamic texts describing paradise as a garden filled with abundant trees , flowers and plants , with water playing a key role : In Paradise four rivers source at a central spring or mountain . In their ideal form they were laid out as a square subdivided into four equal parts . These rivers are often represented in the charbagh as shallow canals which separate the garden by flowing towards the cardinal points . The canals represent the promise of water , milk , wine and honey . The centre of the garden , at the intersection of the divisions is highly symbolically charged and is where , in the ideal form , a pavilion , pool or tomb would be situated . The tombs of Humayun , Akbar and Jahangir , the previous Mughal emperors , follow this pattern . The cross axial garden also finds independent precedents within South Asia dating from the 5th century where the royal gardens of Sigiriya in Sri Lanka were laid out in a similar way .

The central picture showed three generations of a family raising a toast to the card 's recipient : on either side were scenes of charity , with food and clothing being given to the poor . Allegedly the image of the family drinking wine together proved controversial , but the idea was shrewd : Cole had helped introduce the Penny Post three years earlier .

{"question":"american horror story freak show girl kidnapped by clown","short_answers":["Bonnie Lipton (portrayed by Skyler Samuels)"],"long_answer":"  Twisty the Clown ( portrayed by John Carroll Lynch ) originally was a slow - witted but gentle clown at a freak show in 1943 . Jealous of his popularity , the freaks of the carnival spread rumors that he was a child molester and drove him away . With nowhere else to go , he returned home to Jupiter , Florida , only to find that his mother had died . After failing to support himself by selling toys made of junk to a local toy store , Twisty attempted suicide by putting a shotgun in his mouth . However , the attempt failed -- he succeeded only in mutilating his lower jaw -- and he later began to wear a grinning mask over the lower part of his face . Twisty then tried to perform as a clown at Elsa 's freak show , but was turned away . Twisty then snapped and went on a killing spree , abducting children to be his audience , while murdering their `` mean '' parents . He kidnaps Corey Bachman and murders his parents , after kidnapping Bonnie Lipton to serve as his audience 's babysitter . Gloria hires Twisty to entertain Dandy , who becomes his accomplice . Twisty and Dandy hold a magic show on Halloween , before Jimmy knocks Dandy unconscious and Maggie gets Corey and Bonnie to safety . Twisty then knocks Jimmy out before encountering Edward Mordrake , who was attracted by the noise of the clown 's performance . Twisty tells Mordrake his story , and Mordrake deems the clown suitable to be in his entourage of damned souls and kills him . When Elsa summons Mordrake in 1962 , Twisty appears alongside the other freaks and comforts her in her last moments . According to director Ryan Murphy , Lynch was so terrifying as this character that `` half the time , almost a third of the crew left the set when they shot his scenes because they were afraid of him . '' In Cult , a comic book detailing a fictionalized version of Twisty is owned by Oz Mayfair - Richards .   Bonnie Lipton ( portrayed by Skyler Samuels ) is a young girl who is kidnapped by Twisty , after Twisty murders her boyfriend Troy . She attacks Twisty and attempts to escape with Corey , but is dragged back to him by Dandy . She escapes Twisty with the help of Jimmy and Maggie in `` Edward Mordrake ( Part 2 ) '' .   Regina Ross ( portrayed by Gabourey Sidibe as older Regina , Nya Auzenne as young Regina ) is a student at secretary school hoping to get a position at a law firm after graduation , who returns home to Jupiter when her mother Dora goes MIA . In `` Pink Cupcakes '' , she calls Gloria concerning her mother and why she has n't been returning her calls . The conversation turns strange and Regina feels uncomfortable and hangs up , wary of what happened . She turns up at the Mott Manor in `` Blood Bath '' , very suspicious of where her mother is . She threatens to call the police if she does n't see her mother soon . In `` Tupperware Party Massacre '' , Dandy admits to the murder of Dora and lets Regina escape unharmed , despite her refusal to take a blood bath with him . Upon returning with police detective Jack Colquitt , Dandy admits to the murders and boasts about his family 's wealth , buying off Colquitt for a million dollars . Regina is killed when Dandy orders Colquitt to shoot and bury her .   Dora Ross ( portrayed by Patti LaBelle ) is a local townswoman who begins to discover secrets about Dandy . She is the mother of Regina and the put - upon maid to Gloria Mott . In `` Massacres and Matinees '' , she reveals to Gloria that she found dissected animal parts behind the shed , implying they belong to Dandy . She dislikes Dandy 's spoiled attitude and did n't get scared of him when he tried to kill her . In `` Edward Mordrake ( Part 2 ) '' , she dies when Dandy slashes her throat and Gloria helps bury her in their backyard .   Paul ( portrayed by Mat Fraser ) also known as Paul The Illustrated Seal is a performer in the freak show , who was born with phocomelia of both arms . In `` Edward Mordrake ( Part 2 ) '' , he tells Mordrake that he immigrated to the United States from Britain to be in show business . However , he arrived during the Great Depression . In an act of despair , he tattooed his whole body except his face , because he believed that it would have been considered handsome and loveable if it was n't on a freak . It is revealed that he is not only Elsa 's secret lover , but that of Penny too , his true love . He confronts Elsa in `` Bullseye '' about the recent disappearance of Bette and Dot , and she in turn snaps at him for his relationship with Penny . She later becomes angry about a public confrontation with the rest of the troupe and demands one of them place themselves on the spinning wheel , to prove their trust of her . Paul volunteers and it is assumed she purposely threw the last knife into his gut , injuring him badly , leaving him bed ridden . He is then shocked and guilt - stricken later on in `` Test of Strength '' over Penny 's mutilation . In `` Curtain Call '' , after trying to stand up to Dandy , he is the first freak to be shot and killed during Dandy 's massacre . He and the other freaks appear when Elsa joins the freak show in the afterlife , where he and Penny have gotten married .   Eve ( portrayed by Erika Ervin ) also known as Amazon Eve is a performer in the freak show . She is abnormally large . She is seen as the piano player of the show and is also instrumental with protecting the troupe , along with Jimmy and Paul . In `` Bullseye '' , she becomes concerned over Ma Petite 's disappearance until Maggie turns up with her , healthy and alive . Initially , Eve is somewhat quiet and even - tempered , but in `` Test of Strength '' , Dell attempts to murder her in her caravan . Afraid that he is attempting to rape her , Eve defends herself by savagely beating him and throws him out . She goes to Ethel where she cares for her bruised hand . She and the other women of the freak show then plot to kill Dell once and for all . In `` Curtain Call '' , she is the last freak to be killed by Dandy after she tries to overpower him in Desiree 's caravan . She and the other freaks appear when Elsa joins the freak show in the afterlife .   Mahadevi Patel ( portrayed by Jyoti Amge ) also known as Ma Petite , is a performer in the freak show , who also serves as Elsa 's assistant . She is seen playing a miniature violin of sorts and also serves as Elsa 's manicurist and `` cuddle '' toy in the later hours . She was born with achondroplasia which results in an extremely short stature , and is thus deemed the world 's shortest woman . Seen as the baby of the troupe , Ma Petite 's sweet nature and naive innocence leads her to trust almost everyone , with ultimately tragic consequences . Maggie lures her away one night attempts to murder her in `` Bullseye '' for Stanley , but ca n't force herself to go through with it . In `` Test of Strength '' , Dell , under the pretense of gifting her with a new dress , hugs her and then squeezes until her spine snaps and she dies . He gives her body to Stanley and it is later seen being presented by Lillian in her Museum of Morbid Curiosities in a jar of formaldehyde , where her birth name is revealed . The carnies later find her bloody dress in an area full of unidentified bones , and believe that she has been eaten by a wild animal . She later appears to Dell in a hallucination before he attempts suicide by hanging . She and the other freaks appear when Elsa joins the freak show in the afterlife , where Ma Petite once again helps Elsa to get ready for her performance .   Lillian Hemmings ( portrayed by Celia Weston ) is the curator of the Museum of Morbid Curiosities ; she collects and buys strange artifacts for her museum . She catches Stanley and Maggie 's fraudulence but says if she is offered something of real worth from a freak show , she will pay big money . Stanley regularly imagines scenarios with her presenting him with money and acclaim for his finds . In `` Test of Strength '' , she unveils her new exhibit to various wealthy people of Ma Petite 's dead body ( presented as Mahadevi Patel , the world 's smallest woman ) , floating in a jar of what is assumed to be formaldehyde . In `` Orphans '' , she is seen revealing Jimmy 's claw hands . In `` Show Stoppers '' , it is revealed that she was murdered by Desiree shortly after Maggie 's fainting spell ; her decapitated and preserved head is given to Stanley before the freaks attack and mutilate him .   Penny ( portrayed by Grace Gummer ) is a candy striper at the local hospital . In the first episode , she is drugged and kidnapped by Elsa and taken back with her to the freak show . She is blackmailed by Elsa into staying at the camp because Elsa filmed her in a drug - fueled orgy with the freaks . It is later revealed she is in a relationship with Paul , but her father begins to abuse her over the affair . In `` Test of Strength '' , she attempts to move out but before she can do so , her father Vince hires a man to mutilate her face -- tattooing her with scales , giving her a forked tongue , and shaving half her hair off while she is unconscious . She is accepted by the freak show and takes the name The Astounding Lizard Girl . In `` Blood Bath '' , she and the women of the freak show kidnap her father and feather and tar him for what he did , but she spares his life after being persuaded by Maggie . In `` Curtain Call '' , she is shot and killed during Dandy 's massacre . She and the other freaks appear when Elsa joins the freak show in the afterlife , where she and Paul have gotten married .

{"question":"name the cell which is attached to the lateral side of sieve tube","short_answers":["sieve tube elements"],"long_answer":" In plant anatomy , sieve tube elements , also called sieve tube members , are highly specialised type of elongated cell in the phloem tissue of flowering plants . The ends of these cells are connected with other sieve tube members , and together they constitute the sieve tube . The main function of the sieve tube is transport of carbohydrates , primarily sucrose , in the plant ( e.g. , from the leaves to the fruits and roots ) . Unlike the water - conducting xylem vessel elements that are dead when mature , sieve elements are living cells . They are unique in lacking a nucleus at maturity . ","category":"fully specified","judgment":"fully specified","reasoning":"This question is fully specified because it refers to a well-defined biological structure (sieve tube) and asks for the specific cell type attached to its lateral side. The term \"companion cell\" is the standard anatomical term for this relationship in plant vascular systems.

With the Titans now in the city , Eren recalls his lessons that in order to kill a Titan , they must strike the nape of its neck . As Eren and Armin 's squad attack , their comrades are killed or eaten by the Titans one by one , with Eren himself losing his left leg . Armin , paralyzed with fear upon seeing his comrades ' fates , is picked up by a Bearded Titan and almost swallowed . Eren , recalling when he and Armin wished to see the world outside the walls , manages to drag and toss Armin out of the Bearded Titan 's mouth at the last moment . He reaches for Armin with his left arm out of the Bearded Titan 's mouth , but the Bearded Titan closes its jaws , severing Eren 's arm and swallowing him .     6   6   `` The World the Girl Saw : The Struggle for Trost , Part 2 '' `` Sh\u014djo ga Mita Sekai - Torosuto - ku K\u014db\u014dsen ( 2 ) - '' ( \u5c11\u5973 \u304c \u898b \u305f \u4e16\u754c \u2015 \u30c8\u30ed\u30b9\u30c8 \u533a \u653b\u9632 \u6226 2 \u2015 )   Tomomi Ikeda   Hiroshi Seko   May 12 , 2013   June 7 , 2014     Armin awakens to find himself surrounded by Conny Springer , Christa Lenz and Ymir . As Armin heads back to the rearguard , he blames himself not being strong enough to save Eren . Meanwhile , an Abnormal Titan approaches the city 's exit gate , which is crowded by refugees . Once Mikasa kills the Abnormal Titan , she threatens a greedy merchant holding cargo to let the refugees pass first . After she is thanked by a mother and daughter , Mikasa has a flashback . In the year 844 , a year before the fall of Wall Maria , Mikasa was targeted by three slave traders , who murdered her parents in a struggle . After Grisha and Eren discovered the corpses while making a visit , Eren secretly tracked down the slave traders to a nearby hut and killed two of them in an attempt to save Mikasa . However , the third slave trader appeared and began strangling Eren . Encouraged by Eren , Mikasa overcame her fear and gained resolve to kill the third slave trader . After the children are found by the Military Police Regiment , Mikasa was invited to live with Eren and Grisha . Back in the present , Mikasa slays more Titans and goes to help the other squads evacuate .     7   7   `` Small Blade : The Struggle for Trost , Part 3 '' `` Chiisana Yaiba - Torosuto - ku K\u014db\u014dsen ( 3 ) - '' ( \u5c0f\u3055\u306a \u5203 \u2015 \u30c8\u30ed\u30b9\u30c8 \u533a \u653b\u9632 \u6226 3 \u2015 )   Yuzuru Tachikawa   Hiroshi Seko   May 19 , 2013   June 14 , 2014     The surviving squads , unable to reach the inner walls due to their omni - directional mobility gear being low on gas , lose their fighting spirit as the nearby supply depot is overrun by Titans .

She rallies the others to reclaim the supply depot , inspiring them to join her in the attack , but Mikasa ends up running out of gas midair and falls into an alleyway . Jean assumes command , but he loses his nerve when he sees some of his comrades being eaten by Titans . As a blonde Titan approaches Mikasa , she prepares to attack with her remaining broken blade , but a Mysterious Titan appears behind her and brutally kills the blonde Titan , much to her confusion . Armin and Conny show up , shocked to witness the Mysterious Titan not only fighting other Titans , but also showing knowledge of their weak point and using hand - to - hand combat techniques , while completely ignoring the humans .

Armin 's plan works , but while the Mysterious Titan is able to attract the enemies outside , seven smaller Titans remain in the fuel storage area . With their equipment out of fuel , Armin devises another plan . The survivors draw the Titans ' attention to an elevator and shoot them in the eyes to blind them , while seven of them jump from the ceiling to finish them off . Sasha and Conny fail to kill their targets but are saved by Mikasa and Annie . Having successfully replenished their fuel , the soldiers prepare to retreat . As they see the Mysterious Titan defeating all of the other Titans before collapsing , they are shocked to watch Eren emerge from its body .

When Eren was eaten and swallowed by the Bearded Titan , he found himself in its stomach along with the bodies of its victims . His rage at the Titans caused him to burst out of the Bearded Titan 's stomach by transforming himself into the Mysterious Titan and going on a rampage against them . Although Eren 's comrades saw him emerge from the Mysterious Titan , they all agreed to keep it a secret and bring him back inside Wall Rose . However , Kitts also witnessed this and has his men aim their weapons at Eren . Armin and Mikasa try to defend Eren , but to no avail . As Kitts fearfully orders the cannons to fire on the three of them , Eren recalls hazy memories of his father giving him an injection , telling him to reclaim Wall Maria and go to their home 's basement with his key .

Eren comes up with two plans of escape . The first is for Eren to retreat as the Mysterious Titan and criminalize himself in the eyes of humanity , and the second is to have Armin convince Kitts that Eren is an asset rather than a danger . Armin comes to the conclusion that he can still defend his friends despite being cowardice , deciding to try and talk their way out of being executed . Armin tentatively convinces Kitts , only to have him be overcome by fear and give the order to fire once more . The order is halted when Commander Dot Pyxis and his men intervene , sparing their lives . In return , Pyxis asks Eren if he will transform himself to block the gap in Wall Rose to prevent more Titans from getting in .

Some members of the Women 's Social and Political Union ( WSPU , commonly referred to as suffragettes ) had been imprisoned for acts of vandalism in support of women 's suffrage . In protest to being imprisoned some of these suffragettes undertook hunger strikes . These suffragettes were then force - fed leading to a public outcry . This act was a response to the outcry ; it allowed the prisoners to be released on licence as soon as the hunger strike affected their health . They then had a period of time in which they could recover . After a predetermined period of time the prisoner would be rearrested to serve out the rest of their sentence . Conditions could be placed on the prisoner during the time of their release . The hunger strikes themselves were now technically legal . However , the Act allowed for the re-imprisonment of the hunger strikers upon their recovery on their original charges .

These dependencies were often called `` protectorates '' or `` trucial states '' . By this system , the day - to - day government and administration of areas both small and large was left in the hands of traditional rulers , who gained prestige and the stability and protection afforded by the Pax Britannica , at the cost of losing control of their external affairs , and often of taxation , communications , and other matters , usually with a small number of European `` advisors '' effectively overseeing the government of large numbers of people spread over extensive areas .

{"question":"what age do you need to be to buy a bb gun","short_answers":["18"],"long_answer":" Under federal law , airsoft guns are not classified as firearms and are legal for all ages . People under the age of 18 are not permitted to buy airsoft guns over the counter in stores . However , a person of any age may use one ( with the permission of their parents of course for anyone under 18 ) . This is also the case for the laws in each state . However , in some major cities , the definition of a firearm within their respected ordinances includes propulsion by spring or compressed air , thus making airsoft subject to applicable laws . For example , airsoft guns within the state of California can only be bought by a person above the age of 18 . However , no laws indicate an age requirement to sell airsoft guns . Generally speaking , toy , look - alike , and imitation firearms must have an orange tip during shipping and transportation . ","category":"Undetermined lexicons or references","judgment":"underspecified","reasoning":"The request is underspecified because the age requirement to purchase a BB gun depends on the jurisdiction or country, as laws vary significantly across regions.

Commercial Internet service providers ( ISPs ) began to emerge in the very late 1980s . The ARPANET was decommissioned in 1990 . Limited private connections to parts of the Internet by officially commercial entities emerged in several American cities by late 1989 and 1990 , and the NSFNET was decommissioned in 1995 , removing the last restrictions on the use of the Internet to carry commercial traffic .

{"question":"today gestalt psychology ideas are part of which branch of psychology","short_answers":["Berlin School of experimental psychology"],"long_answer":" Gestalt psychology or gestaltism ( German : Gestalt ( \u0261\u0259\u02c8\u0283talt ) `` shape , form '' ) is a philosophy of mind of the Berlin School of experimental psychology . Gestalt psychology is an attempt to understand the laws behind the ability to acquire and maintain meaningful perceptions in an apparently chaotic world . The central principle of gestalt psychology is that the mind forms a global whole with self - organizing tendencies . The assumed physiological mechanisms on which Gestalt theory rests are poorly defined and support for their existence is lacking . The Gestalt theory of perception has been criticized as being descriptive of the end products of perception without providing much insight into the processes that lead to perception . In the introduction to a 2016 special issue of the journal Vision Research on Gestalt perception , the authors concluded that `` even though they study the same phenomena as earlier Gestaltists , there is little theoretical coherence . What happened to the Gestalt school that always aspired to provide a unified vision of psychology ? Perhaps there is , in fact , little that holds the classic phenomena of Gestalt psychology together .

{"question":"what went wrong on the columbia space shuttle","short_answers":["a piece of foam insulation broke off from the Space Shuttle external tank and struck the left wing of the orbiter"],"long_answer":" During the launch of STS - 107 , Columbia 's 28th mission , a piece of foam insulation broke off from the Space Shuttle external tank and struck the left wing of the orbiter . A few previous shuttle launches had seen damage ranging from minor to major from foam shedding , but some engineers suspected that the damage to Columbia was more serious . NASA managers limited the investigation , reasoning that the crew could not have fixed the problem if it had been confirmed . When Columbia re-entered the atmosphere of Earth , the damage allowed hot atmospheric gases to penetrate and destroy the internal wing structure , which caused the spacecraft to become unstable and break apart . ","category":"fully specified","judgment":"fully specified","reasoning":"This question is fully specified because it refers to a well-documented historical event \u2014 the 2003 Columbia space shuttle disaster \u2014 and asks for the factual cause of the accident. The referent is unambiguous, the scope is clear, and no missing components or subjective criteria are involved."}
{"question":"what states do not allow daylight savings time","short_answers":["Arizona","Navajo"],"long_answer":" Daylight saving time in the United States is the practice of setting the clock forward by one hour during the warmer part of the year , so that evenings have more daylight and mornings have less . Most areas of the United States observe daylight saving time ( DST ) , the exceptions being Arizona ( except for the Navajo , who do observe daylight saving time on tribal lands ) , Hawaii , and the overseas territories of American Samoa , Guam , the Northern Mariana Islands , Puerto Rico , and the United States Virgin Islands . The Uniform Time Act of 1966 established the system of uniform Daylight Saving Time throughout the US . ","category":"Undetermined lexicons or references","judgment":"underspecified","reasoning":"The request is underspecified because the phrase \u201cdo not allow\u201d can be interpreted in multiple ways. It could refer to states that do not observe Daylight Saving Time (DST) at all, or it could refer to states where DST is not enforced in certain regions (e.g., parts of Alaska or Arizona). Additionally, the question lacks clarity on whether it refers to U.S. states or other jurisdictions, and whether it includes territories like American Samoa or Puerto Rico. These ambiguities make the question underspecified."}
{"question":"where are unipolar neurons found in spinal cord","short_answers":["the distal dorsal root"],"long_answer":" The soma ( cell body ) of each pseudounipolar neuron is located within a dorsal root ganglion . The axon leaves the cell body ( and out of the dorsal root ganglion ) into the dorsal root , where it splits into two branches . The central branch goes to the posterior ( dorsal ) horn of the spinal cord , where it forms synapses with other neurons . The peripheral branch travels through the distal dorsal root into the spinal nerve all the way until skin , joint , and muscle . ","category":"fully specified","judgment":"fully specified","reasoning":"The question is fully specified because it asks for a precise anatomical fact: the location of unipolar neurons within the spinal cord. While unipolar neurons are not found in the spinal cord itself, their cell bodies are located in the dorsal root ganglia, which are connected to the spinal cord via the dorsal roots. The referent is clear, and the question does not require subjective interpretation or missing components."}

In 618 , after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle Abu Talib , Muhammad took flight to the city of Yathrib ( subsequently called Medina ) where he was joined by his followers .

{"question":"what percentage of sunlight is captured by plants to convert it into food energy","short_answers":["3 to 6%"],"long_answer":" where C H O is glucose ( which is subsequently transformed into other sugars , cellulose , lignin , and so forth ) . The value of the photosynthetic efficiency is dependent on how light energy is defined -- it depends on whether we count only the light that is absorbed , and on what kind of light is used ( see Photosynthetically active radiation ) . It takes eight ( or perhaps 10 or more ) photons to utilize one molecule of CO . The Gibbs free energy for converting a mole of CO to glucose is 114 kcal , whereas eight moles of photons of wavelength 600 nm contains 381 kcal , giving a nominal efficiency of 30 % . However , photosynthesis can occur with light up to wavelength 720 nm so long as there is also light at wavelengths below 680 nm to keep Photosystem II operating ( see Chlorophyll ) . Using longer wavelengths means less light energy is needed for the same number of photons and therefore for the same amount of photosynthesis . For actual sunlight , where only 45 % of the light is in the photosynthetically active wavelength range , the theoretical maximum efficiency of solar energy conversion is approximately 11 % . In actuality , however , plants do not absorb all incoming sunlight ( due to reflection , respiration requirements of photosynthesis and the need for optimal solar radiation levels ) and do not convert all harvested energy into biomass , which results in an overall photosynthetic efficiency of 3 to 6 % of total solar radiation . If photosynthesis is inefficient , excess light energy must be dissipated to avoid damaging the photosynthetic apparatus . Energy can be dissipated as heat ( non-photochemical quenching ) , or emitted as chlorophyll fluorescence . ","category":"fully specified","judgment":"fully specified","reasoning":"This question is fully specified because it asks for a well-documented scientific fact: the general efficiency of photosynthesis in converting sunlight into chemical energy.

{"question":"when was the taming ofthe shrew first performed","short_answers":["prior to June 1592"],"long_answer":" However , it is possible to narrow the date further . A terminus ante quem for A Shrew seems to be August 1592 , as a stage direction at 3.21 mentions `` Simon , '' which probably refers to the actor Simon Jewell , who was buried on 21 August 1592 . Furthermore , The Shrew must have been written earlier than 1593 , as Anthony Chute 's Beauty Dishonoured , written under the title of Shore 's wife ( published in June 1593 ) contains the line `` He calls his Kate , and she must come and kiss him . '' This must refer to The Shrew , as there is no corresponding `` kissing scene '' in A Shrew . There are also verbal similarities between both Shrew plays and the anonymous play A Knack to Know a Knave ( first performed at The Rose on 10 June 1592 ) . Knack features several passages common to both A Shrew and The Shrew , but it also borrows several passages unique to The Shrew . This suggests The Shrew was on stage prior to June 1592 .

{"question":"who plays steve's wife on my three sons","short_answers":["Beverly Garland"],"long_answer":" The following year in the tenth season , 1969 - 1970 , Steve remarries , taking widowed teacher Barbara Harper ( Beverly Garland ) as his wife ; she brings with her a 5 - year - old daughter , Dorothy `` Dodie '' ( Dawn Lyn ) , so Steven now had a stepdaughter whom he also subsequently adopts . ( Dodie is wary of Steve at first , believing that he wants her to simply forget her late father , until he explains that he wants her to always remember and love him , but since he 's no longer alive , Steve wants to raise her in his place , and hopes she 'll come to love him also . ) Also , the last year - and - a-half of the series feature fewer appearances of both Don Grady and Stanley Livingston . Grady 's character was written out of the show at the end of the 11th season , which allowed for his wife Katie and their triplet sons to remain within the Douglas household the following season ( as a structural engineer Robbie was working on a bridge construction in Peru ) . Chip and his teenaged wife Polly ( Ronne Troup ) ( who eloped after Polly 's disciplinarian father refused to sanction their marriage ) move into their own apartment .

{"question":"where does the highway of heroes start and end","short_answers":["between Glen Miller Road in Trenton and the Don Valley Parkway \/ Highway 404 Junction in Toronto"],"long_answer":" By the end of 1952 , three individual highways were numbered `` Highway 401 '' : the partially completed Toronto Bypass between Weston Road and Highway 11 ( Yonge Street ) ; Highway 2A between West Hill and Newcastle ; and the Scenic Highway between Gananoque and Brockville , now known as the Thousand Islands Parkway . These three sections of highway were 11.8 , 54.7 and 41.2 km , ( 7.3 , 34.0 and 25.6 mi ) , respectively . In 1964 , the route became fully navigable from Windsor to the Ontario -- Quebec border . In 1965 it was given a second designation , the Macdonald -- Cartier Freeway , in honour of two Fathers of Confederation . At the end of 1968 , the Gananoque -- Brockville section was bypassed and the final intersection grade - separated near Kingston , making Highway 401 a freeway for its entire 817.9 - km length . On August 24 , 2007 , the portion of the highway between Glen Miller Road in Trenton and the Don Valley Parkway \/ Highway 404 Junction in Toronto was designated the Highway of Heroes , as the road is travelled by funeral convoys for fallen Canadian Forces personnel from CFB Trenton to the coroner 's office in Toronto . On September 27 , 2013 , the Highway of Heroes designation was extended west to Keele Street in Toronto , to coincide with the move of the coroner 's office to the new Forensic Services and Coroner 's Complex at the Humber River Hospital . ","category":"Undetermined lexicons or references","judgment":"underspecified","reasoning":"The request is underspecified because the phrase \u201cHighway of Heroes\u201d is not a widely recognized or standardized term, and its referent depends on context (e.g., a fictional game, a real-world location, or a metaphorical concept).

{"question":"when was kudzu introduced to the united states","short_answers":["1876"],"long_answer":" The kudzu plant was introduced to the United States from Japan in 1876 at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia . Kudzu was introduced to the Southeast in 1883 at the New Orleans Exposition . The vine was widely marketed in the Southeast as an ornamental plant to be used to shade porches , and in the first half of the 20th century , kudzu was distributed as a high - protein content cattle fodder and as a cover plant to prevent soil erosion . It was cultivated by Civilian Conservation Corps workers as a solution for the erosion during the Dust Bowl . The Soil Erosion Service recommended the use of kudzu to help control erosion of slopes which led to the government - aided distribution of 85 million seedlings and government - funded plantings of kudzu which paid $19.75 per hectare . By 1946 , it was estimated that 1,200,000 hectares ( 3,000,000 acres ) of kudzu had been planted . When boll weevil infestations and the failure of cotton crops caused farmers to abandon their farms , kudzu plantings were left unattended . The climate and environment of the Southeastern United States allowed the kudzu to grow virtually unchecked . In 1953 the United States Department of Agriculture removed kudzu from a list of suggested cover plants and listed it as a weed in 1970 . By 1997 , the vine was placed on the `` Federal Noxious Weed List '' . Today , kudzu is estimated to cover 3,000,000 hectares ( 7,400,000 acres ) of land in the southeastern United States , mostly in Alabama , Georgia , Tennessee , Florida , North Carolina , South Carolina and Mississippi .

Sabine 's father is to be moved to the capital city for a public execution so Sabine plans to rescue him as he is being transported there .

Just before the two groups clash , the white Loth - Wolf reappears and leads them into a hidden tunnel complex imbued with the Force . Walking mysterious paths , the rebels inexplicably find themselves in a hidden settlement halfway across the planet which was visited in ancient times by the Jedi who erected the secret temple on Lothal , and discover that the Loth - Wolf is a messenger of the Force , here to tell them of a more sinister goal pursued by the Empire .     67   8   `` Crawler Commandeers ''   Bosco Ng   Matt Michnovetz   November 6 , 2017 ( 2017 - 11 - 06 )   408   N \/ A     After the Lothal rebels have taken shelter in the ancient settlement , they discover a Mining Guild ore crawler stripping Lothal 's surface for raw materials passing by , and decide to hijack it to establish contact with Hera and the Yavin rebel base with its communicators .

Working together , the rebels and the former slaves allay an incoming Imperial patrol investigating the distress call and prevent the captain from destroying the crawler . In the meantime , Hera , unwilling to wait any longer , inspires rebel command to conduct an immediate assault on the factory where the TIE Defender is being produced , and after communication is established , Ezra 's team agrees to coordinate the impending assault from the planet 's surface .     68   9   `` Rebel Assault ''   Steward Lee   Dave Filoni & Steven Melching   November 13 , 2017 ( 2017 - 11 - 13 )   409   N \/ A     Hera and her assault team arrive at Lothal and begin to battle their way past the Imperial blockade , while the Ghost crew on the ground sabotage the anti-aircraft batteries to allow an unhindered attack on the TIE factory at Lothal 's capital .

Others have taken advantage of technological advances to work from their homes . These processes often occur in more economically developed countries , especially in the United States , which is believed to be the first country in which the majority of the population lives in the suburbs , rather than in the cities or in rural areas . Proponents of containing urban sprawl argue that sprawl leads to urban decay and a concentration of lower income residents in the inner city .

{"question":"who developed the central processing unit (cpu)","short_answers":["John von Neumann"],"long_answer":" The idea of a stored - program computer was already present in the design of J. Presper Eckert and John William Mauchly 's ENIAC , but was initially omitted so that it could be finished sooner . On June 30 , 1945 , before ENIAC was made , mathematician John von Neumann distributed the paper entitled First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC . It was the outline of a stored - program computer that would eventually be completed in August 1949 . EDVAC was designed to perform a certain number of instructions ( or operations ) of various types . Significantly , the programs written for EDVAC were to be stored in high - speed computer memory rather than specified by the physical wiring of the computer . This overcame a severe limitation of ENIAC , which was the considerable time and effort required to reconfigure the computer to perform a new task . With von Neumann 's design , the program that EDVAC ran could be changed simply by changing the contents of the memory . EDVAC , however , was not the first stored - program computer ; the Manchester Small - Scale Experimental Machine , a small prototype stored - program computer , ran its first program on 21 June 1948 and the Manchester Mark 1 ran its first program during the night of 16 -- 17 June 1949 .

At this point the ball is fed into the gap between the two forward packs and they both compete for the ball to win possession . Teams can be penalised for intentionally causing the scrum to collapse , and for not putting the ball into the scrum correctly . A scrum is most commonly awarded when the ball is knocked forward , or passed forward , or when a ball becomes trapped in a ruck or maul . Because of the physical nature of scrums , injuries can occur , especially in the front row . ","category":"fully specified","judgment":"fully specified","reasoning":"This question is fully specified because it asks for the primary objective of a rugby scrum, which is a well-defined aspect of the sport. The term \"point\" here refers to the purpose or goal of the scrum, which is to gain possession of the ball and advance it toward the opposing team's try zone.

These isolated links developed during the railway boom of the 1840s into a national network , although still run by dozens of competing companies . Over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries , these amalgamated or were bought by competitors until only a handful of larger companies remained ( see railway mania ) . The entire network was brought under government control during the First World War and a number of advantages of amalgamation and planning were revealed . However , the government resisted calls for the nationalisation of the network . In 1923 , almost all the remaining companies were grouped into the `` big four '' , the Great Western Railway , the London and North Eastern Railway , the London , Midland and Scottish Railway and the Southern Railway . The `` Big Four '' were joint - stock public companies and they continued to run the railway system until 31 December 1947 .

{"question":"when was the term social justice first used","short_answers":["the 1840s"],"long_answer":" The first modern usage of the specific term `` social justice '' is typically attributed to Catholic thinkers from the 1840s , including the Jesuit Luigi Taparelli in Civilt\u00e0 Cattolica , based on the work of St. Thomas Aquinas . He argued that rival capitalist and socialist theories , based on subjective Cartesian thinking , undermined the unity of society present in Thomistic metaphysics as neither were sufficiently concerned with moral philosophy . Writing in 1861 , the influential British philosopher and economist , John Stuart Mill stated in Utilitarianism his view that `` Society should treat all equally well who have deserved equally well of it , that is , who have deserved equally well absolutely . This is the highest abstract standard of social and distributive justice ; towards which all institutions , and the efforts of all virtuous citizens , should be made in the utmost degree to converge .

{"question":"when was the last wolf pack killed in yellowstone","short_answers":["by 1926"],"long_answer":" It is generally accepted that sustainable gray wolf packs had been extirpated from Yellowstone National Park by 1926 , although the National Park Service maintained its policies of predator control in the park until 1933 . However , a 1975 -- 77 National Park Service sponsored study revealed that during the period 1927 to 1977 , there were several hundred probable sightings of wolves in the park . Between 1977 and the re-introduction in 1995 , there were additional reliable sightings of wolves in the park , most believed to be singles or pairs transiting the region . ","category":"Undetermined standard or preference","judgment":"underspecified","reasoning":"The request is underspecified because the phrase \"killed\" is ambiguous in the context of Yellowstone's wolf population. Wolves in Yellowstone are protected under the Endangered Species Act, so \"killed\" could refer to historical hunting, relocation, or other interventions.

It was not until the 1930s that B.F. Skinner suggested that private events -- including thoughts and feelings -- should be subjected to the same controlling variables as observable behavior , which became the basis for his philosophy called radical behaviorism .

In his entries to the baby , he often shows disdain by using degrading terms to talk to it such as `` Smelly '' or `` Blob of unformed goo '' . But he writes it to be a good older brother to this new baby since Scott 's own brother was never very present . As time goes by , Scott tries to find his place , but he starts to lose his best friends . Mitch finds a girlfriend and soon forgets the group , Patrick moves to Texas , then to Japan , and Kyle joins the wrestling team and soon puts Scott down for having a crush on Julia .

{"question":"who was the first imperial power that was fighting in vietnam","short_answers":["France"],"long_answer":" Full - scale war broke out between the Vi\u1ec7t Minh and France in late 1946 and the First Indochina War officially began . Realizing that colonialism was coming to an end worldwide , France decided to bring former emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i back to power , as a political alternative to Ho Chi Minh . A Provisional Central Government was formed in 1948 , reuniting Annam and Tonkin , but the complete reunification of Vietnam was delayed for a year because of the problems posed by Cochinchina 's legal status . In July 1949 , the State of Vietnam was officially proclaimed , as a semi-independent country within the French Union , with B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i as Head of State . France was finally persuaded to relinquish its colonies in Indochina in 1954 when Viet Minh forces defeated the French at Dien Bien Phu . The 1954 Geneva Conference left Vietnam a divided nation , with H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh 's communist DRV government ruling the North from Hanoi and Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m 's Republic of Vietnam , supported by the United States , ruling the South from Saigon . Between 1953 and 1956 , the North Vietnamese government instituted various agrarian reforms , including `` rent reduction '' and `` land reform '' , which resulted in significant political oppression . During the land reform , testimony from North Vietnamese witnesses suggested a ratio of one execution for every 160 village residents , which extrapolated nationwide would indicate nearly 100,000 executions . Because the campaign was concentrated mainly in the Red River Delta area , a lower estimate of 50,000 executions became widely accepted by scholars at the time . However , declassified documents from the Vietnamese and Hungarian archives indicate that the number of executions was much lower than reported at the time , although likely greater than 13,500 . In the South , Diem went about crushing political and religious opposition , imprisoning or killing tens of thousands .

It is a place of `` infinite nothingness '' , where the competitors can fight without limits . The tournament champion will be granted a wish by the Super Dragon Balls , while the losers and their respective universes will be completely erased from existence .

Whis tells Goku that Zen\u014d - sama has already made up his mind and attempting to change it could be dangerous . Beerus demands that Goku takes responsibility for asking Zen\u014d - sama to hold the tournament in the first place . Goku declares that he will defeat any opponent he faces . The Great Priest also reveals that Universes 7 and 9 are to have a smaller exhibition tournament for Future Zen\u014d - sama 's benefit . Each universe is to name three fighters .

Goku goads Basil into showing his full power to get Majin Buu 's attention , which leads to Basil using his ultimate attack . As Roh ( \u30ed\u30a6 , R\u014d ) , the Supreme Kai of Universe 9 , claims victory , Majin Buu emerges with a hole in his stomach , but he is otherwise unmoved . Basil and Roh are shocked to see this . Mr. Satan is injured during the attack . He tells Majin Buu to beat Basil before falling unconscious . This enrages Majin Buu to the point , where he effortlessly beats Basil and knocks him out of the ring . However , since neither Zen\u014d - sama is satisfied with the fight , Basil is allowed to get back into the ring . Roh gives Basil a drug that makes him far more powerful . Although Beerus demands that Basil is disqualified for obvious cheating , Zen\u014d - sama is entertained by this and allows the fight to continue .

Shin offers Gohan a Senzu bean to cure the poison , but Gohan refuses and says he wants to fight with his strength alone . Unable to see , Gohan uses his other senses to track Lavender and scores several blows . Lavender counters by levitating , which eliminates the sound of his footsteps . Gohan responds by powering up to Super Saiyan and bouncing his own ki off of Lavender 's body , which uses it as a kind of active radar . Powering up also causes the poison to spread rapidly through Gohan 's body . Lavender mounts a comeback . In desperation , Gohan grabs hold of Lavender and launches a kamikaze attack . He drives both of their bodies into the ring at high speed . Lavender is knocked out , but Gohan is so weakened by the poison that he can not continue . With both fighters down , the match is declared a tie . After Goku feeds Gohan a Senzu bean , the Great Priest announces to those in attendance that all universes that lose the Tournament of Power will be erased with their respective gods as well . However , Universes 1 , 5 , 8 , and 12 will be exempt from erasure as will the Angels from all universes because their inhabitants are particularly strong . Zeno - sama had long believed that there were too many universes . He was planning to erase most of them anyway , but the tournament will afford one of the weaker universes the chance to be spared .

Zen\u014d - sama agrees on the condition that Bergamo beats Goku in an all out battle . Great Priest states that if Goku holds back to cancel the erasure , Zen\u014d - sama will immediately erase all of the universes . Both Goku and Bergamo agree to the terms . When the fight begins , Bergamo invites Goku to hit him and leaves himself exposed . Goku obliges and strikes Bergamo several times , but Bergamo absorbs the energy of Goku 's attacks . He grows stronger and physically larger . Goku continues to attack , which causes Bergamo to grow so large that the ring begins to buckle under his weight . Goku transforms to Super Saiyan Blue , which shocks the gods and quickly overwhelms Bergamo with a Kaioken powered Kamehameha . Bergamo claims every universe participating in the Tournament of Power will seek vengeance on Goku for making them face erasure , but Goku relishes the idea of such a challenge . The Zen Exhibition Match comes to a close and the Tournament of Power will soon begin . The universe with the most fighters remaining or the last fighter standing will be declared the winner .

He begins squeezing the life out of Goku , which forces Goku to turn Super Saiyan Blue to escape . Goku gains the upper hand in this form and damages Toppo with a Kamehameha . Just as the two power up even more , the Great Priest puts an end to the fight . As Toppo leaves , he reveals to Goku that Universe 11 has a warrior even stronger than him named Jiren ( \u30b8\u30ec\u30f3 ) .

Trunks and Goten are ruled out due to their inexperience . They proceed to ask Vegeta , who has been thinking of a name for his second child . Vegeta refuses to participate . He says he will not fight , while Bulma is pregnant . Whis uses his time warping ability to birth the baby sooner than expected in order to get Vegeta to agree to the fight . Everyone celebrates the baby 's birth . Trunks is slightly disappointed he has a sister because he wanted to train with a younger brother .

Civil wars and executions continued , culminating in the victory of Octavian , Caesar 's adopted son , over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt . Octavian 's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title Augustus , effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic .

{"question":"what are the parts of a domain name called","short_answers":["top-level domain","subdomain","hostname"],"long_answer":"  The right-most label conveys the top - level domain ; for example , the domain name www.example.com belongs to the top - level domain com .   The hierarchy of domains descends from the right to the left label in the name ; each label to the left specifies a subdivision , or subdomain of the domain to the right . For example : the label example specifies a node example.com as a subdomain of the com domain , and www is a label to create www.example.com , a subdomain of example.com . Each label may contain from 1 to 63 octets . The empty label is reserved for the root node and when fully qualified is expressed as the empty label terminated by a dot . The full domain name may not exceed a total length of 253 ASCII characters in its textual representation . Thus , when using a single character per label , the limit is 127 levels : 127 characters plus 126 dots have a total length of 253 . In practice , some domain registries may have shorter limits .   A hostname is a domain name that has at least one associated IP address . For example , the domain names www.example.com and example.com are also hostnames , whereas the com domain is not . However , other top - level domains , particularly country code top - level domains , may indeed have an IP address , and if so , they are also hostnames .   Hostnames impose restrictions on the characters allowed in the corresponding domain name . A valid hostname is also a valid domain name , but a valid domain name may not necessarily be valid as a hostname .  ","category":"fully specified","judgment":"fully specified","reasoning":"This question is fully specified because it asks for the standard terminology used to describe the components of a domain name, which are well-defined in networking. The referent is clear (domain name structure), and the request does not require subjective interpretation, missing components, or multiple perspectives. The answer would include terms like top-level domain (TLD), second-level domain, and subdomains, which are universally recognized."}

Goku defeats them , but he is injured in the process . Deciding that he has grown rusty , Goku and Goten decide to train with Whis . They head to the Capsule Corporation building , where Bulma reveals she is pregnant with her and Vegeta 's second child . Goten remains behind to train with Trunks . Vegeta declines to accompany Goku so that he can be with Bulma when she gives birth . Goku heads to Beerus ' planet alone . While training with Whis , Goku remembers Grand Zen\u014d 's intention to hold a multiverse martial arts tournament .

It is a place of `` infinite nothingness '' , where the competitors can fight without limits . The tournament champion will be granted a wish by the Super Dragon Balls , while the losers and their respective universes will be completely erased from existence . Everyone is horrified by this harsh penalty . Goku suggests asking Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d to ignore it , but Whis advises against this . Whis tells Goku that Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d has already made up his mind and attempting to change it could be dangerous . Beerus demands that Goku takes responsibility for asking Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d to hold the tournament in the first place . Goku declares that he will defeat any opponent he faces . The Grand Minister also reveals that Universes 7 and 9 are to have a smaller exhibition tournament for Future Grand Zen\u014d 's benefit . Each universe is to name three fighters . Goku sets off to recruit teammates . After Vegeta refuses , Goku recruits Gohan and Majin Buu , who is accompanied by Mr. Satan to represent Universe 7 . Goku also explains the potential penalty to Gohan . Gohan tells Goku to keep the stakes a secret to prevent mass panic . Back at Grand Zen\u014d 's and Future Grand Zen\u014d 's palace , all the gods from all 12 universes gather . The Grand Minister explains the purpose of the Zen Exhibition Match . He alludes to the possibility of Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d erasing the fighters that he deems unfit for the tournament . In the first round , Majin Buu is to fight Basil ( \u30d0\u30b8\u30eb , Bajiru ) , a humanoid canine fighter from Universe 9 .     79     `` Universe 9 's Basil the Kicker VS Universe 7 's Majin Buu ! !

Goku goads Basil into showing his full power to get Majin Buu 's attention , which leads to Basil using his ultimate attack . As Roh ( \u30ed\u30a6 , R\u014d ) , the Supreme Kai of Universe 9 , claims victory , Majin Buu emerges with a hole in his stomach , but he is otherwise unmoved . Basil and Roh are shocked to see this . Mr. Satan is injured during the attack . He tells Majin Buu to beat Basil before falling unconscious . This enrages Majin Buu to the point , where he effortlessly beats Basil and knocks him out of the ring . However , since neither Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d is satisfied with the fight , Basil is allowed to get back into the ring . Roh gives Basil a drug that makes him far more powerful . Although Beerus demands that Basil is disqualified for obvious cheating , Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d is entertained by this and allows the fight to continue . The Grand Minister announces that the rules will be improvised as the tournament goes along . Basil overpowers Majin Buu and seemingly beats him , which causes Roh to prematurely gloat about the superiority of Universe 9 . However , Majin Buu emerges unscathed and launches a full power attack at Basil . This knocks him out and clinches Universe 7 the victory . As the Universe 9 team laments Basil 's loss , Basil 's second oldest brother Lavender ( \u30e9\u30d9\u30f3\u30c0 , Rabenda ) says that if he is allowed to kill his opponent , which Bergamo gives him permission to do , he can win his match .

Shin offers Gohan a Senzu bean to cure the poison , but Gohan refuses and says he wants to fight with his strength alone . Unable to see , Gohan uses his other senses to track Lavender and scores several blows . Lavender counters by levitating , which eliminates the sound of his footsteps . Gohan responds by powering up to Super Saiyan and bouncing his own ki off of Lavender 's body , which uses it as a kind of active radar . Powering up also causes the poison to spread rapidly through Gohan 's body . Lavender mounts a comeback . In desperation , Gohan grabs hold of Lavender and launches a kamikaze attack . He drives both of their bodies into the ring at high speed . Lavender is knocked out , but Gohan is so weakened by the poison that he can not continue . With both fighters down , the match is declared a tie . After Goku feeds Gohan a Senzu bean , the Grand Minister announces to those in attendance that all universes that lose the Tournament of Power will be erased with their respective gods as well . However , Universes 1 , 5 , 8 , and 12 will be exempt from erasure as will the Angels from all universes because their inhabitants are particularly strong . Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d had long believed that there were too many universes . He was planning to erase most of them anyway , but the tournament will afford one of the weaker universes the chance to be spared . With the announcement concluded , the ring is repaired in preparation for the final exhibition match where Goku will fight Bergamo ( \u30d9\u30eb\u30ac\u30e2 , Berugamo ) , Basil 's oldest brother who is also a humanoid canine .     81   5   `` Bergamo the Crusher Vs Son Goku !

Bergamo pleads with Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d to rescind the rule that the universes that lose the Tournament of Power be erased . Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d agree on the condition that Bergamo beats Goku in an all out battle . Grand Minister states that if Goku holds back to cancel the erasure , Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d will immediately erase all of the universes . Both Goku and Bergamo agree to the terms . When the fight begins , Bergamo invites Goku to hit him and leaves himself exposed . Goku obliges and strikes Bergamo several times , but Bergamo absorbs the energy of Goku 's attacks . He grows stronger and physically larger . Goku continues to attack , which causes Bergamo to grow so large that the ring begins to buckle under his weight . Goku transforms to Super Saiyan Blue , which shocks the gods and quickly overwhelms Bergamo with a Kaioken powered Kamehameha . Bergamo claims every universe participating in the Tournament of Power will seek vengeance on Goku for making them face erasure , but Goku relishes the idea of such a challenge . The Zen Exhibition Match comes to a close and the Tournament of Power will soon begin . The universe with the most fighters remaining or the last fighter standing will be declared the winner . Suddenly , a mysterious fighter from Universe 11 named Toppo ( \u30c8\u30c3\u30dd ) appears and challenges Goku to a battle . Goku , who is unsatisfied after his short fight with Bergamo , agrees to fight Toppo .     82   6   `` Never Forgive Son Goku ! Toppo the Warrior of Justice Intrudes ! !

Toppo quickly gains the upper hand and dislocates Goku 's shoulder . Goku responds by attacking with a flurry of blows , but Toppo manages to grab Goku in a powerful bear hug . He begins squeezing the life out of Goku , which forces Goku to turn Super Saiyan Blue to escape . Goku gains the upper hand in this form and damages Toppo with a Kamehameha . Just as the two power up even more , the Grand Minister puts an end to the fight . As Toppo leaves , he reveals to Goku that Universe 11 has a warrior even stronger than him named Jiren ( \u30b8\u30ec\u30f3 ) . The Grand Minister begins creating a martial arts arena suitable for the Tournament of Power .

They discuss who should be on the team . Goku immediately suggests Monaka , but Beerus tells him that Monaka is sick and can not participate . Goku and Gohan agree on Vegeta , Piccolo , Krillin , Master Roshi , No. 18 , and No. 17 , which would bring the total number of fighters up to nine . Trunks and Goten are ruled out due to their inexperience . They proceed to ask Vegeta , who has been thinking of a name for his second child . Vegeta refuses to participate . He says he will not fight , while Bulma is pregnant . Whis uses his time warping ability to birth the baby sooner than expected in order to get Vegeta to agree to the fight . Everyone celebrates the baby 's birth . Trunks is slightly disappointed he has a sister because he wanted to train with a younger brother . As soon as the baby is handed to Vegeta , he develops an attachment to her . Bulma names the baby Bulla even though Vegeta hoped to give her the Saiyan name Eschalot .

She quickly suspects Goku and Gohan of hiding something from them , but Goku convinces her that the secret is a 10 million Zeni reward , which convinces her to participate . Gohan decides to test Krillin in a sparring match on the coast . After Gohan overpowers him in hand to hand combat , Krillin swiftly defeats Gohan by blinding him with his new move named Solar Flare x 100 and knocking him into the sea . Goku is excited by Krillin 's new power . He challenges him to a sparring match as well . They relocate to a building owned by Mr. Satan , where Krillin 's strategies make up for the gap in power , forcing Goku to go Super Saiyan . Goku then transforms into his Super Saiyan Blue form , and he and Krillin have a Kamehameha clash . As Goku increases his power and starts to overpower Krillin , No. 18 intervenes and blocks Goku 's Kamehameha , just as Krillin collapses from exhaustion . She justifies herself by noting that the Tournament of Power will be a battle royal and that Goku can not expect to fight one - on - one all the time .

Piccolo is able to sense Damon 's attacks , but he proves unable to hit Damon , who knocks him out of the ring and eliminates him . No. 17 discovers the truth and exposes Damon as a tiny bug - like creature rather than an invisible person , which explains why none of the fighters were able to hit him . To solve this problem , Goku repeatedly punches the ring and creates shock waves that launch Damon into the air , which cancels out his agility and allows No. 17 to hit him with energy blasts . No. 17 traps Damon in a miniature force field and kicks him out of the ring to eliminate him .

Title   Directed by   Written by   Original air date   U.S. viewers ( millions )       `` Burnt Food ''   Seth Gordon   David Shore   September 25 , 2017 ( 2017 - 09 - 25 )   11.22     On the way to begin his surgical residency at San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital , Dr. Shaun Murphy witnesses an airport sign fall and shatter glass onto a young boy . Another doctor is first on the scene and begins applying pressure to the child 's neck . Shaun tells him that he 's pressing on the wrong part of the neck for a child . With his unique ability to visualize the internal body and using improvised methods and tools , Shaun is able to stabilize the boy . On the way to the hospital , Shaun notices that the boy 's vitals have changed . Hospital staff are alerted to the arrival of the boy . Shaun tries to tell the doctors about the boy 's vitals , stating that he needs an echo - cardiogram . The doctors disagree and begin surgery . While operating , something goes wrong and Claire Browne , a surgical resident , recalls Shaun mentioning an echo . Thanks to Shaun 's diagnosis , the boy 's life is saved . Meanwhile , in a hospital board meeting , Dr. Aaron Glassman , president of the hospital , tries to convince the board to hire Shaun , despite his autism . Flashbacks give us a picture of Shaun 's childhood and his motivation for becoming a doctor .       `` Mount Rushmore ''   Mike Listo   David Shore   October 2 , 2017 ( 2017 - 10 - 02 )   10.93     Dr. Melendez is doing rounds with Dr. Browne and Dr. Kalu . Melendez calls out Shaun for arriving late on his first full day . A middle aged woman is brought into the ER with abdominal pain . Shaun immediately diagnoses a malignant tumor . Melendez assigns Browne as his number two for the surgery while giving Shaun `` scut work '' - all the work that residents hate doing . On the operating table , the doctors find the tumor is much bigger than expected and has encased all of her arteries . Looking at biopsy results , the residents find out that she is suffering from leiomyosarcoma , making surgery seemingly impossible . Shaun 's ability to visualize the internal organs allows him to figure out that removing one of her kidneys would allow a better look , enough to view and possibly remove the mass . To Browne 's dismay , Kalu suggests Shaun 's idea to Melendez , getting the credit for the idea . Meanwhile , Shaun 's attention to detail in his scut work gets him into trouble . Instead of releasing patients ready for discharge , Shaun rechecks them and orders additional tests . Upon learning this , Melendez assigns Nurse Freydey as Shaun 's `` boss '' for the day . Later , after rechecking a discharged young girl 's test results , Shaun races to her home . The parents are annoyed that he 's bothering them after midnight and at first refuse to let him in . Shaun insists he will not leave before seeing their daughter . His diagnosis is correct and they must rush her to the hospital for surgery to save her life .       `` Oliver ''   John Dahl   Bill Rotko   October 9 , 2017 ( 2017 - 10 - 09 )   10.69     Shaun and Claire fly to San Francisco Municipal Hospital to get a patient a liver . They ca n't fly on their way back due to fog and are forced to use a police escort . Problems keep coming one after the other ; first , the liver 's temperature went above the required maximum , forcing them to have a sudden stop at a local store , where they cool it by submerging it in slush . As they proceed with their journey , Shaun discovers that the liver has a clot . With only two hours of viability left , the duo decide to perform an operation on the way in order to remove the clot and flash the left lobe , to protect it from the ice bath . Back at San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital , Chuck , the recipient of the liver , is discovered to have alcohol in his system ; a likelihood that he might be moved to the bottom of the list . Chuck later confesses that he actually took a drink on his daughter 's graduation . In order to protect its reputation and the future patients , the hospital decides to move Chuck to the bottom of the list . To their dismay , Shaun and Claire arrive back , only to find out that the liver has to be taken to another patient in another hospital .       `` Pipes ''   Steven DePaul   Thomas L. Moran   October 16 , 2017 ( 2017 - 10 - 16 )   10.60     Through an ultrasound , an expectant woman 's baby is diagnosed with a tumor at his tail bone ; the mom has Antiphospholipid syndrome , making surgery a high risk . Dr. Melendez suggests termination of the pregnancy but Shaun interjects by suggesting clotting pre-operatively with an infusion of unfractionated heparin . Things are further complicated when the woman and eventually her husband refuse to terminate the baby . During surgery , there is a complication ; a blood clot at the artery in her heart . Dr. Kalu has an idea that they should stop her heart and put her on a bypass machine for the duration of the surgery ; that way she wo n't have an heart attack , which turns out to be successful and the doctors reveal she 's carrying a baby boy . With a patient needing a boil lanced , Dr. Melendez assigns Shaun and Dr. Browne on the case , as a punishment for being late . The patient turns out to be a pornographic actress ; she does n't have a boil but a large Bartholin gland abscess and they prep her for surgery the following day . They successfully drain the abscess but discover that she has a Perineal myoma underneath . The fibroid tumor is wrapped around the nerve that facilitates feeling in her genitals . Therefore , the doctors have to remove the tumor but they have to sever the nerve ; hence , losing all feeling in her genitals . Shaun comes up the idea of grafting the distal end of the pudendal nerve to the branch of the femoral cutaneous nerve from her inner thigh ; this will lead to her losing feeling in her thigh while preserving feeling in her genitals .     5   `` Point Three Percent ''   Larry Teng   David Hoselton   October 23 , 2017 ( 2017 - 10 - 23 )   10.39     Shaun notices a young boy with an indubitable resemblance to his deceased brother Steve , forming a bond with him . The boy 's name is actually Evan and was brought to the hospital by his parents for reportedly breaking an arm ; unbeknownst to Evan , he is in fact suffering from stage 4 Osteosarcoma . Shaun later suspects that he might have been misdiagnosed with cancer but indeed was suffering from Langerhans cell histiocytosis . In order not to give both Evan and his parents false hopes , Shaun decides to lie , attempting to perform a bone marrow aspiration , but he is caught red - handed by the parents . Subsequently , Evan starts coughing out blood , sending him to the OR . While on the operating table , Dr. Neil Menendez and Dr. Claire Browne discover that the cancer had metastasized , undoubtable proof that he is indeed suffering with terminal cancer . The other doctors are trying to find a prognosis of a 66 - year old man , brought to the hospital by his estranged son , with an allergy causing him to have convulsions . Dr. Browne later finds out that the man is suffering from Echinococcus , a cyst form of tapeworms . Saddened by Evan 's fate , which Evan has in fact known about the whole time , Shaun reads Evan the final few pages of To Kill a Mockingbird , a book of Steve 's that he never finished reading before he died .     6   `` Not Fake ''   Michael Patrick Jann   Simran Baidwan   October 30 , 2017 ( 2017 - 10 - 30 )   10.60     Shaun and the rest of the residents are working the graveyard shift when numerous casualties from a wedding bus crash come in . Among the victims are a woman with severe , visible burns , on whom Dr. Kalu tries an experimental procedure , and a young man with a damaged leg who can either have it amputated , or have an artificial bone inserted . The relative newness of the latter procedure causes a conflict between the man 's parent and his soon - to - be bride .     7   `` 22 Steps ''   David Straiton   Johanna Lee   November 13 , 2017 ( 2017 - 11 - 13 )   10.14     Shaun encounters Liam , an autistic patient brought in to San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital . Having to face prejudice from the young man 's parents , Dr. Melendez defends him for the first time and acknowledges his exceptional abilities . On Dr. Glassman 's directive , Claire continues her therapy sessions in order to curb her guilt over the death of a patient she inadvertently caused in the previous episode . On the other hand , Dr. Kalu gets a 73 - year - old man with severe chest pains thus needing urgent medical attention and a pacemaker but his desire is to die ; in order to give him hope on life , Dr. Kalu does everything he can to have him accept treatment , to no avail in which the latter finally lets him sign the DNR .     8   `` Apple ''   Nestor Carbonell   David Renaud   November 20 , 2017 ( 2017 - 11 - 20 )   9.97     While shopping at a grocery mart for apples , a robbery takes place . With Shaun 's communication limitations , he puts the lives of two customers on a first date at risk , leading to a young woman getting shot . Shaun 's neighbor Lea hugs him after he admits that he made a mistake with someone getting hurt . During surgery , Dr. Lim questions Claire 's ability to not let her emotions get the better of her because of a racist patient . This leads to a fight between the two with Dr. Lim ordering Claire to leave the operating room . Claire puts her emotions in check to save the life of the racist patient much to the satisfaction and delight of Dr. Lim .     9   `` Intangibles ''   Bronwen Hughes   Karen Struck   November 27 , 2017 ( 2017 - 11 - 27 )   9.25     The team takes on the case of a young boy from the Congo who has severe congenital heart anomalies ; Murphy 's latest encounter with his neighbor Lea has him confused . He takes flirting lessons from Dr. Browne and notes and charts what he sees in regards to the `` flirting trifecta '' . Meanwhile , Dr. Browne along with a lab tech search for a misplaced tissue sample from a woman with possible throat cancer .     10   `` Sacrifice ''   Michael Patrick Jann   Lloyd Gilyard Jr .   December 4 , 2017 ( 2017 - 12 - 04 )   9.03     In Dr. Glassman 's office , Shaun sees the therapist hired to help him with in - home visits . He reluctantly agrees to meet with her , but changes his mind after meeting a new patient , Bobby Ato , who convinces him to stop letting people tell him what he can and ca n't do . Ato is a champion gamer , who is in St. Bonaventure for surgery to repair torn ligaments in his left arm . After an MRI , cancer is discovered , making an additional surgery much more complicated and results in doubt . Shaun avoids meeting with his therapist by sleeping in the hospital custodian 's closet at night . Finally , a confrontation with Glassman in the hospital lobby leads to Shaun having a meltdown , causing him to strike Glassman in the face and run out of the hospital . Meanwhile , Claire runs into an uncomfortable situation with a new doctor , Dr. Matt Coyle , who makes unwanted sexual advances toward her . After telling Jared about this , he confronts the doctor and physically threatens him . As a result , Jared is fired . Later , Dr. Melendez and Jessica have dinner with her father . In a tense situation , Melendez criticizes Mr. Preston as living off his father 's money instead of contributing to society . When Preston offers to pay for their wedding so Jessica can quit her job and start a family , an angry Melendez calls him a `` parasite . '' The next day , Melendez apologizes to Jessica for his remarks and learns that she does n't want to have children .     11   `` Islands Part One ''   Bill D'Elia   Thomas L.
