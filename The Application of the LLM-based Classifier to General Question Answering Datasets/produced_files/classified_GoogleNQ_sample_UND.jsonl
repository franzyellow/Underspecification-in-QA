They were the first architectural expression the new empire made in the Indian sub-continent , and fulfilled diverse functions with strong symbolic meanings . The symbolism of these gardens is derived from mystic Islamic texts describing paradise as a garden filled with abundant trees , flowers and plants , with water playing a key role : In Paradise four rivers source at a central spring or mountain . In their ideal form they were laid out as a square subdivided into four equal parts . These rivers are often represented in the charbagh as shallow canals which separate the garden by flowing towards the cardinal points . The canals represent the promise of water , milk , wine and honey . The centre of the garden , at the intersection of the divisions is highly symbolically charged and is where , in the ideal form , a pavilion , pool or tomb would be situated . The tombs of Humayun , Akbar and Jahangir , the previous Mughal emperors , follow this pattern .

Conditions could be placed on the prisoner during the time of their release . The hunger strikes themselves were now technically legal .

{"question":"what states do not allow daylight savings time","short_answers":["Arizona","Navajo"],"long_answer":" Daylight saving time in the United States is the practice of setting the clock forward by one hour during the warmer part of the year , so that evenings have more daylight and mornings have less . Most areas of the United States observe daylight saving time ( DST ) , the exceptions being Arizona ( except for the Navajo , who do observe daylight saving time on tribal lands ) , Hawaii , and the overseas territories of American Samoa , Guam , the Northern Mariana Islands , Puerto Rico , and the United States Virgin Islands . The Uniform Time Act of 1966 established the system of uniform Daylight Saving Time throughout the US . ","category":"Undetermined lexicons or references","judgment":"underspecified","reasoning":"The request is underspecified because the phrase \u201cdo not allow\u201d can be interpreted in multiple ways. It could refer to states that do not observe Daylight Saving Time (DST) at all, or it could refer to states where DST is not enforced in certain regions (e.g., parts of Alaska or Arizona). Additionally, the question lacks clarity on whether it refers to U.S. states or other jurisdictions, and whether it includes territories like American Samoa or Puerto Rico.

{"question":"when does a building need a fire pump","short_answers":["the local municipal water system cannot provide sufficient pressure to meet the hydraulic design requirements of the fire sprinkler system"],"long_answer":" Fire pumps are needed when the local municipal water system can not provide sufficient pressure to meet the hydraulic design requirements of the fire sprinkler system . This usually occurs if the building is very tall , such as in high - rise buildings , or in systems that require a relatively high terminal pressure at the fire sprinkler in order to provide a large volume of water , such as in storage warehouses . Fire pumps are also needed if fire protection water supply is provided from a ground level water storage tank . ","category":"Missing necessary components","judgment":"underspecified","reasoning":"The request is underspecified because it lacks critical contextual details about the building type (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial), its size, or the specific fire safety regulations of the location. These factors determine whether a fire pump is required, as requirements vary based on building classification, occupancy, and local fire codes. Without this information, the question cannot be fully answered."}
{"question":"right to property according to the constitution of india is a","short_answers":["constitutional right"],"long_answer":" The provisions relating to the right to property were changed a number of times . The Forty - Fourth Amendment of 1978 deleted the right to property from the list of fundamental rights A new provision , Article 300 - A , was added to the constitution , which provided that `` no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law '' . Thus if a legislature makes a law depriving a person of his property , there would be no obligation on the part of the State to pay anything as compensation . The aggrieved person shall have no right to move the court under Article 32 . Thus , the right to property is no longer a fundamental right , though it is still a constitutional right . If the government appears to have acted unfairly , the action can be challenged in a court of law by aggrieved citizens . ","category":"Undetermined standard or preference","judgment":"underspecified","reasoning":"The request is underspecified because the phrase \"is a\" lacks a complete sentence, and the question does not clarify whether it refers to the historical classification (as a fundamental right) or the current status (as a constitutional right) under the Indian Constitution.

{"question":"where does the highway of heroes start and end","short_answers":["between Glen Miller Road in Trenton and the Don Valley Parkway \/ Highway 404 Junction in Toronto"],"long_answer":" By the end of 1952 , three individual highways were numbered `` Highway 401 '' : the partially completed Toronto Bypass between Weston Road and Highway 11 ( Yonge Street ) ; Highway 2A between West Hill and Newcastle ; and the Scenic Highway between Gananoque and Brockville , now known as the Thousand Islands Parkway . These three sections of highway were 11.8 , 54.7 and 41.2 km , ( 7.3 , 34.0 and 25.6 mi ) , respectively . In 1964 , the route became fully navigable from Windsor to the Ontario -- Quebec border . In 1965 it was given a second designation , the Macdonald -- Cartier Freeway , in honour of two Fathers of Confederation . At the end of 1968 , the Gananoque -- Brockville section was bypassed and the final intersection grade - separated near Kingston , making Highway 401 a freeway for its entire 817.9 - km length . On August 24 , 2007 , the portion of the highway between Glen Miller Road in Trenton and the Don Valley Parkway \/ Highway 404 Junction in Toronto was designated the Highway of Heroes , as the road is travelled by funeral convoys for fallen Canadian Forces personnel from CFB Trenton to the coroner 's office in Toronto . On September 27 , 2013 , the Highway of Heroes designation was extended west to Keele Street in Toronto , to coincide with the move of the coroner 's office to the new Forensic Services and Coroner 's Complex at the Humber River Hospital .

{"question":"when does sloan come into grey's anatomy","short_answers":["season two"],"long_answer":" Mark first appears in season two , introduced as a highly respected otolaryngologist sub-specialized in plastic surgery and the childhood best friend of neurosurgeon Derek Shepherd ( Patrick Dempsey ) . In his first appearance , he flirts with Meredith Grey , and Derek punches him in the face . Derek explains that Mark had an affair with his wife , Addison ( Kate Walsh ) while they were living in New York . Mark travels to Seattle , intent on convincing Addison to return with him , but his offer is rejected and Derek declines to renew their friendship . Mark returns during season three at Addison 's drunken behest , but she again rejects him once sober . Undeterred , Mark sells his successful private practice ( which he previously shared with Derek ) and takes over the plastics program at Seattle Grace Hospital . During Meredith 's morphine rampage , Mark finds out about his nickname McSteamy which was given to him by her during his first trip to Seattle back when he attempted to get Addison back and earn Derek 's friendship back . It is later revealed that Mark has at some point slept with all of Derek 's sisters . Mark has a brief fling with Addison 's friend , orthopedic surgeon Callie Torres ( Sara Ramirez ) , and develops a friendship with Derek 's girlfriend , intern Meredith Grey ( Ellen Pompeo ) . It is revealed that after Derek left New York , Mark and Addison continued their relationship for two months , during which she conceived and aborted his child . Just weeks after moving to Seattle he quickly observes that Derek 's true love was Meredith and tries to convince Addison that her marriage with Derek was over . Mark enters into a sixty - day abstinence pact with Addison , agreeing that if they can remain celibate for that time , Addison will give their relationship another chance . Addison ultimately breaks the pact by having sex with intern Alex Karev ( Justin Chambers ) , and soon thereafter departs from Seattle to work in Los Angeles .

{"question":"how much of the world's diamonds does de beers own","short_answers":["33% in 2013"],"long_answer":" In 2000 , the De Beers business model changed because of factors such as the decision by producers in Canada and Australia to distribute diamonds outside the De Beers channel , as well as rising awareness of blood diamonds that forced De Beers to `` avoid the risk of bad publicity '' by limiting sales to its own mined products . De Beers ' market share of rough diamonds fell from as high as 90 % in the 1980s to 33 % in 2013 , because of a more fragmented diamond market bringing greater competition , as well as more transparency and greater liquidity . In November 2011 , the Oppenheimer family announced its intention to sell all its 40 % stake in De Beers to Anglo American plc , thereby increasing Anglo American 's ownership of the company to 85 % ( the other 15 % is owned by the Government of the Republic of Botswana ) .

{"question":"what were the results of the development of florida's railroads","short_answers":["towns grew and farmland was cultivated along the rail line"],"long_answer":" A pattern of political and financial motivation , and a lack of understanding of the geography and ecology of the Everglades have plagued the history of drainage projects . The Everglades are a part of a massive watershed that originates near Orlando and drains into Lake Okeechobee , a vast and shallow lake . As the lake exceeds its capacity in the wet season , the water forms a flat and very wide river , about 100 miles ( 160 km ) long and 60 miles ( 97 km ) wide . As the land from Lake Okeechobee slopes gradually to Florida Bay , water flows at a rate of half a mile ( 0.8 km ) a day . Before human activity in the Everglades , the system comprised the lower third of the Florida peninsula . The first attempt to drain the region was made by real estate developer Hamilton Disston in 1881 . Disston 's sponsored canals were unsuccessful , but the land he purchased for them stimulated economic and population growth that attracted railway developer Henry Flagler . Flagler built a railroad along the east coast of Florida and eventually to Key West ; towns grew and farmland was cultivated along the rail line .

The Bonhomme Richard and Serapis entered a bitter engagement at about 6 : 00 p.m. The battle continued for the next four hours , costing the lives of nearly half of the American and British crews . British victory seemed inevitable , as the more heavily armed Serapis used its firepower to rake Bonhomme Richard with devastating effect . The commander of the Serapis finally called on Jones to surrender . He replied , `` Sir , I have not yet begun to fight ! '' Jones eventually managed to lash the ships together , nullifying his opponent 's greater maneuverability and allowing him to take advantage of the larger size and considerably more numerous crew of Bonhomme Richard . An attempt by the Americans to board Serapis was repulsed , as was an attempt by the British to board Bonhomme Richard . Finally , after another of Jones 's ships joined the fight , the British captain was forced to surrender at about 10 : 30 p.m. The Bonhomme Richard -- shattered , on fire , leaking badly -- defied all efforts to save her and sank about 36 hours later at 11 : 00 a.m. on Saturday , 25 September 1779 .

Zenger High as a freshman , along with his three best friends , Mitch , Patrick , and Kyle , and quickly realizes that it is very different from middle school . Upperclassmen are intimidating and will steal any lunch money along with loose change if you stand in the wrong place . Scott gets put in advanced classes , including an Honors English class which , despite the amount of homework , is his favorite class . His teacher , Mr. Franka , becomes a mentor to him . Scott finds out that he 's not in classes with his friends since he 's carrying all honors and college prep classes . He tries his best from the very start to get the attention of Julia Baskins , a girl who was in his kindergarten class and has recently become very beautiful over the summer . Because of her beauty she quickly blends in with the popular girls and is attracted to the football players who are often bullying Scott . Scott is also connected to another classmate named Louden , who is better known as Mouth . Scott tries every attempt to get Julia 's attention such as joining the school paper , because he thinks that she is part of the staff , only to discover that she has written only a single column for the paper . He then runs for student council , after finding out that Julia is also running as well , and wins a seat , only to find out that she has not won . Because of this , Scott resigns from his position on the student council . It turns out that a lot of other members also resigned including the president meaning Julia who happened to have the 2nd most amount of votes is now president . He also auditions for the school play and is selected as a member of the crew , thinking that Julia is also auditioning for the play . However , Julia has not been selected as a member of the cast or crew . Soon , a new girl named Lee arrives at school , who wears face pins and weird clothes , and has wildly colored hair . Both soon realize that they share the same interests , but he ca n't get past his crush on Julia . Scott suddenly has another `` friend '' named Wesley , a high school senior . Though they share some interests , they have little in common . Then to put the cherry on top of all this excitement going on in his life , his mother announces that she is pregnant . He copes with all of this by creating a tip book for his soon - to - be baby sibling to help him , or her , survive high school when they get to it . In his entries to the baby , he often shows disdain by using degrading terms to talk to it such as `` Smelly '' or `` Blob of unformed goo '' .

As time goes by , Scott tries to find his place , but he starts to lose his best friends . Mitch finds a girlfriend and soon forgets the group , Patrick moves to Texas , then to Japan , and Kyle joins the wrestling team and soon puts Scott down for having a crush on Julia . Soon , Julia 's boyfriend Vernon beats up Scott after finding out from Kyle ( who lost a fight with Scott ) that Scott has a crush on his girlfriend . Scott realizes that what a person says and does can affect the life of another after Mouth attempts to commit suicide . Later , he learns that not everything is what it seems once he finds out that his older brother , Bobby , who is struggling to find a job , can barely read .

It is a place of `` infinite nothingness '' , where the competitors can fight without limits . The tournament champion will be granted a wish by the Super Dragon Balls , while the losers and their respective universes will be completely erased from existence . Everyone is horrified by this harsh penalty . Goku suggests asking Zen\u014d - sama to ignore it , but Whis advises against this . Whis tells Goku that Zen\u014d - sama has already made up his mind and attempting to change it could be dangerous . Beerus demands that Goku takes responsibility for asking Zen\u014d - sama to hold the tournament in the first place . Goku declares that he will defeat any opponent he faces . The Great Priest also reveals that Universes 7 and 9 are to have a smaller exhibition tournament for Future Zen\u014d - sama 's benefit . Each universe is to name three fighters .

Goku goads Basil into showing his full power to get Majin Buu 's attention , which leads to Basil using his ultimate attack . As Roh ( \u30ed\u30a6 , R\u014d ) , the Supreme Kai of Universe 9 , claims victory , Majin Buu emerges with a hole in his stomach , but he is otherwise unmoved . Basil and Roh are shocked to see this . Mr. Satan is injured during the attack . He tells Majin Buu to beat Basil before falling unconscious . This enrages Majin Buu to the point , where he effortlessly beats Basil and knocks him out of the ring . However , since neither Zen\u014d - sama is satisfied with the fight , Basil is allowed to get back into the ring . Roh gives Basil a drug that makes him far more powerful . Although Beerus demands that Basil is disqualified for obvious cheating , Zen\u014d - sama is entertained by this and allows the fight to continue . The Great Priest announces that the rules will be improvised as the tournament goes along . Basil overpowers Majin Buu and seemingly beats him , which causes Roh to prematurely gloat about the superiority of Universe 9 .

Shin offers Gohan a Senzu bean to cure the poison , but Gohan refuses and says he wants to fight with his strength alone . Unable to see , Gohan uses his other senses to track Lavender and scores several blows . Lavender counters by levitating , which eliminates the sound of his footsteps . Gohan responds by powering up to Super Saiyan and bouncing his own ki off of Lavender 's body , which uses it as a kind of active radar . Powering up also causes the poison to spread rapidly through Gohan 's body . Lavender mounts a comeback . In desperation , Gohan grabs hold of Lavender and launches a kamikaze attack . He drives both of their bodies into the ring at high speed . Lavender is knocked out , but Gohan is so weakened by the poison that he can not continue . With both fighters down , the match is declared a tie . After Goku feeds Gohan a Senzu bean , the Great Priest announces to those in attendance that all universes that lose the Tournament of Power will be erased with their respective gods as well . However , Universes 1 , 5 , 8 , and 12 will be exempt from erasure as will the Angels from all universes because their inhabitants are particularly strong . Zeno - sama had long believed that there were too many universes . He was planning to erase most of them anyway , but the tournament will afford one of the weaker universes the chance to be spared .

Bergamo pleads with Zen\u014d - sama to rescind the rule that the universes that lose the Tournament of Power be erased . Zen\u014d - sama agrees on the condition that Bergamo beats Goku in an all out battle . Great Priest states that if Goku holds back to cancel the erasure , Zen\u014d - sama will immediately erase all of the universes . Both Goku and Bergamo agree to the terms . When the fight begins , Bergamo invites Goku to hit him and leaves himself exposed . Goku obliges and strikes Bergamo several times , but Bergamo absorbs the energy of Goku 's attacks . He grows stronger and physically larger . Goku continues to attack , which causes Bergamo to grow so large that the ring begins to buckle under his weight . Goku transforms to Super Saiyan Blue , which shocks the gods and quickly overwhelms Bergamo with a Kaioken powered Kamehameha . Bergamo claims every universe participating in the Tournament of Power will seek vengeance on Goku for making them face erasure , but Goku relishes the idea of such a challenge . The Zen Exhibition Match comes to a close and the Tournament of Power will soon begin . The universe with the most fighters remaining or the last fighter standing will be declared the winner . Suddenly , a mysterious fighter from Universe 11 named Toppo ( \u30c8\u30c3\u30dd ) appears and challenges Goku to a battle .

Toppo quickly gains the upper hand and dislocates Goku 's shoulder . Goku responds by attacking with a flurry of blows , but Toppo manages to grab Goku in a powerful bear hug . He begins squeezing the life out of Goku , which forces Goku to turn Super Saiyan Blue to escape . Goku gains the upper hand in this form and damages Toppo with a Kamehameha . Just as the two power up even more , the Great Priest puts an end to the fight . As Toppo leaves , he reveals to Goku that Universe 11 has a warrior even stronger than him named Jiren ( \u30b8\u30ec\u30f3 ) . The Great Priest begins creating a martial arts arena suitable for the Tournament of Power .

{"question":"when does april fools day end at noon","short_answers":["April 1st"],"long_answer":" In Poland , prima aprilis ( `` 1 April '' in Latin ) as a day of jokes is a centuries - long tradition . It is a day in which many jokes are told ; various hoaxes -- sometimes very sophisticated -- are prepared by people , media ( which often cooperate to make the `` information '' more credible ) and even public institutions . Serious activities are usually avoided , and generally every word said on April 1st can be a lie , or a joke . The conviction for this is so strong that the Polish anti-Turkish alliance with Leopold I signed on April 1 , 1683 , was backdated to March 31 . However , for some in Poland prima aprilis ends at noon of April 1st , and prima aprilis jokes after that hour are considered inappropriate and not classy . ","category":"Undetermined perspective or granularity","judgment":"underspecified","reasoning":"The request is underspecified because \"April Fools' Day\" is a single day (April 1st), and the phrase \"end at noon\" introduces a temporal granularity that conflicts with the holiday's nature as a single day.

Title   Directed by   Written by   Original air date   U.S. viewers ( millions )       `` Burnt Food ''   Seth Gordon   David Shore   September 25 , 2017 ( 2017 - 09 - 25 )   11.22     On the way to begin his surgical residency at San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital , Dr. Shaun Murphy witnesses an airport sign fall and shatter glass onto a young boy . Another doctor is first on the scene and begins applying pressure to the child 's neck . Shaun tells him that he 's pressing on the wrong part of the neck for a child . With his unique ability to visualize the internal body and using improvised methods and tools , Shaun is able to stabilize the boy . On the way to the hospital , Shaun notices that the boy 's vitals have changed . Hospital staff are alerted to the arrival of the boy . Shaun tries to tell the doctors about the boy 's vitals , stating that he needs an echo - cardiogram . The doctors disagree and begin surgery . While operating , something goes wrong and Claire Browne , a surgical resident , recalls Shaun mentioning an echo . Thanks to Shaun 's diagnosis , the boy 's life is saved . Meanwhile , in a hospital board meeting , Dr. Aaron Glassman , president of the hospital , tries to convince the board to hire Shaun , despite his autism . Flashbacks give us a picture of Shaun 's childhood and his motivation for becoming a doctor .       `` Mount Rushmore ''   Mike Listo   David Shore   October 2 , 2017 ( 2017 - 10 - 02 )   10.93     Dr. Melendez is doing rounds with Dr. Browne and Dr. Kalu . Melendez calls out Shaun for arriving late on his first full day . A middle aged woman is brought into the ER with abdominal pain . Shaun immediately diagnoses a malignant tumor . Melendez assigns Browne as his number two for the surgery while giving Shaun `` scut work '' - all the work that residents hate doing . On the operating table , the doctors find the tumor is much bigger than expected and has encased all of her arteries . Looking at biopsy results , the residents find out that she is suffering from leiomyosarcoma , making surgery seemingly impossible . Shaun 's ability to visualize the internal organs allows him to figure out that removing one of her kidneys would allow a better look , enough to view and possibly remove the mass . To Browne 's dismay , Kalu suggests Shaun 's idea to Melendez , getting the credit for the idea . Meanwhile , Shaun 's attention to detail in his scut work gets him into trouble . Instead of releasing patients ready for discharge , Shaun rechecks them and orders additional tests . Upon learning this , Melendez assigns Nurse Freydey as Shaun 's `` boss '' for the day . Later , after rechecking a discharged young girl 's test results , Shaun races to her home . The parents are annoyed that he 's bothering them after midnight and at first refuse to let him in . Shaun insists he will not leave before seeing their daughter . His diagnosis is correct and they must rush her to the hospital for surgery to save her life .       `` Oliver ''   John Dahl   Bill Rotko   October 9 , 2017 ( 2017 - 10 - 09 )   10.69     Shaun and Claire fly to San Francisco Municipal Hospital to get a patient a liver . They ca n't fly on their way back due to fog and are forced to use a police escort . Problems keep coming one after the other ; first , the liver 's temperature went above the required maximum , forcing them to have a sudden stop at a local store , where they cool it by submerging it in slush . As they proceed with their journey , Shaun discovers that the liver has a clot . With only two hours of viability left , the duo decide to perform an operation on the way in order to remove the clot and flash the left lobe , to protect it from the ice bath . Back at San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital , Chuck , the recipient of the liver , is discovered to have alcohol in his system ; a likelihood that he might be moved to the bottom of the list . Chuck later confesses that he actually took a drink on his daughter 's graduation . In order to protect its reputation and the future patients , the hospital decides to move Chuck to the bottom of the list . To their dismay , Shaun and Claire arrive back , only to find out that the liver has to be taken to another patient in another hospital .       `` Pipes ''   Steven DePaul   Thomas L. Moran   October 16 , 2017 ( 2017 - 10 - 16 )   10.60     Through an ultrasound , an expectant woman 's baby is diagnosed with a tumor at his tail bone ; the mom has Antiphospholipid syndrome , making surgery a high risk . Dr. Melendez suggests termination of the pregnancy but Shaun interjects by suggesting clotting pre-operatively with an infusion of unfractionated heparin . Things are further complicated when the woman and eventually her husband refuse to terminate the baby . During surgery , there is a complication ; a blood clot at the artery in her heart . Dr. Kalu has an idea that they should stop her heart and put her on a bypass machine for the duration of the surgery ; that way she wo n't have an heart attack , which turns out to be successful and the doctors reveal she 's carrying a baby boy . With a patient needing a boil lanced , Dr. Melendez assigns Shaun and Dr. Browne on the case , as a punishment for being late . The patient turns out to be a pornographic actress ; she does n't have a boil but a large Bartholin gland abscess and they prep her for surgery the following day . They successfully drain the abscess but discover that she has a Perineal myoma underneath . The fibroid tumor is wrapped around the nerve that facilitates feeling in her genitals . Therefore , the doctors have to remove the tumor but they have to sever the nerve ; hence , losing all feeling in her genitals . Shaun comes up the idea of grafting the distal end of the pudendal nerve to the branch of the femoral cutaneous nerve from her inner thigh ; this will lead to her losing feeling in her thigh while preserving feeling in her genitals .     5   `` Point Three Percent ''   Larry Teng   David Hoselton   October 23 , 2017 ( 2017 - 10 - 23 )   10.39     Shaun notices a young boy with an indubitable resemblance to his deceased brother Steve , forming a bond with him . The boy 's name is actually Evan and was brought to the hospital by his parents for reportedly breaking an arm ; unbeknownst to Evan , he is in fact suffering from stage 4 Osteosarcoma . Shaun later suspects that he might have been misdiagnosed with cancer but indeed was suffering from Langerhans cell histiocytosis . In order not to give both Evan and his parents false hopes , Shaun decides to lie , attempting to perform a bone marrow aspiration , but he is caught red - handed by the parents . Subsequently , Evan starts coughing out blood , sending him to the OR . While on the operating table , Dr. Neil Menendez and Dr. Claire Browne discover that the cancer had metastasized , undoubtable proof that he is indeed suffering with terminal cancer . The other doctors are trying to find a prognosis of a 66 - year old man , brought to the hospital by his estranged son , with an allergy causing him to have convulsions . Dr. Browne later finds out that the man is suffering from Echinococcus , a cyst form of tapeworms . Saddened by Evan 's fate , which Evan has in fact known about the whole time , Shaun reads Evan the final few pages of To Kill a Mockingbird , a book of Steve 's that he never finished reading before he died .     6   `` Not Fake ''   Michael Patrick Jann   Simran Baidwan   October 30 , 2017 ( 2017 - 10 - 30 )   10.60     Shaun and the rest of the residents are working the graveyard shift when numerous casualties from a wedding bus crash come in . Among the victims are a woman with severe , visible burns , on whom Dr. Kalu tries an experimental procedure , and a young man with a damaged leg who can either have it amputated , or have an artificial bone inserted . The relative newness of the latter procedure causes a conflict between the man 's parent and his soon - to - be bride .     7   `` 22 Steps ''   David Straiton   Johanna Lee   November 13 , 2017 ( 2017 - 11 - 13 )   10.14     Shaun encounters Liam , an autistic patient brought in to San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital . Having to face prejudice from the young man 's parents , Dr. Melendez defends him for the first time and acknowledges his exceptional abilities . On Dr. Glassman 's directive , Claire continues her therapy sessions in order to curb her guilt over the death of a patient she inadvertently caused in the previous episode . On the other hand , Dr. Kalu gets a 73 - year - old man with severe chest pains thus needing urgent medical attention and a pacemaker but his desire is to die ; in order to give him hope on life , Dr. Kalu does everything he can to have him accept treatment , to no avail in which the latter finally lets him sign the DNR .     8   `` Apple ''   Nestor Carbonell   David Renaud   November 20 , 2017 ( 2017 - 11 - 20 )   9.97     While shopping at a grocery mart for apples , a robbery takes place . With Shaun 's communication limitations , he puts the lives of two customers on a first date at risk , leading to a young woman getting shot . Shaun 's neighbor Lea hugs him after he admits that he made a mistake with someone getting hurt . During surgery , Dr. Lim questions Claire 's ability to not let her emotions get the better of her because of a racist patient . This leads to a fight between the two with Dr. Lim ordering Claire to leave the operating room . Claire puts her emotions in check to save the life of the racist patient much to the satisfaction and delight of Dr. Lim .     9   `` Intangibles ''   Bronwen Hughes   Karen Struck   November 27 , 2017 ( 2017 - 11 - 27 )   9.25     The team takes on the case of a young boy from the Congo who has severe congenital heart anomalies ; Murphy 's latest encounter with his neighbor Lea has him confused . He takes flirting lessons from Dr. Browne and notes and charts what he sees in regards to the `` flirting trifecta '' . Meanwhile , Dr. Browne along with a lab tech search for a misplaced tissue sample from a woman with possible throat cancer .     10   `` Sacrifice ''   Michael Patrick Jann   Lloyd Gilyard Jr .   December 4 , 2017 ( 2017 - 12 - 04 )   9.03     In Dr. Glassman 's office , Shaun sees the therapist hired to help him with in - home visits . He reluctantly agrees to meet with her , but changes his mind after meeting a new patient , Bobby Ato , who convinces him to stop letting people tell him what he can and ca n't do . Ato is a champion gamer , who is in St. Bonaventure for surgery to repair torn ligaments in his left arm . After an MRI , cancer is discovered , making an additional surgery much more complicated and results in doubt . Shaun avoids meeting with his therapist by sleeping in the hospital custodian 's closet at night . Finally , a confrontation with Glassman in the hospital lobby leads to Shaun having a meltdown , causing him to strike Glassman in the face and run out of the hospital . Meanwhile , Claire runs into an uncomfortable situation with a new doctor , Dr. Matt Coyle , who makes unwanted sexual advances toward her . After telling Jared about this , he confronts the doctor and physically threatens him . As a result , Jared is fired . Later , Dr. Melendez and Jessica have dinner with her father . In a tense situation , Melendez criticizes Mr. Preston as living off his father 's money instead of contributing to society . When Preston offers to pay for their wedding so Jessica can quit her job and start a family , an angry Melendez calls him a `` parasite . '' The next day , Melendez apologizes to Jessica for his remarks and learns that she does n't want to have children .     11   `` Islands Part One ''   Bill D'Elia   Thomas L.
