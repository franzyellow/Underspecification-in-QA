These periods, spanning roughly from the 14th to the 18th centuries, saw a shift in how humans understood and interpreted history, moving away from religious and mythical explanations toward more secular, evidence-based, and analytical approaches. Below, I'll outline the key influences and developments that contributed to the modern view of history:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Renaissance Humanism (14th\u201316th Century)**\nThe Renaissance, which began in Italy, marked a revival of interest in classical antiquity (Greek and Roman culture, literature, and philosophy). Renaissance humanists such as Francesco Petrarch and Leonardo Bruni emphasized studying historical texts critically and with a focus on human agency and achievements rather than divine intervention. This period laid the groundwork for a secular interpretation of history.\n\n- **Key Features**: \n  - Emphasis on primary sources: Humanists sought to recover and study original manuscripts from antiquity.\n  - Focus on human-centered narratives: History was seen as a product of human actions, motivations, and decisions rather than purely the will of God.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **The Enlightenment (17th\u201318th Century)**\nThe Enlightenment further shaped the modern view of history by introducing ideas of reason, progress, and empiricism. Enlightenment thinkers like Voltaire, David Hume, and Edward Gibbon argued that history should be studied scientifically and critically, with a focus on cause-and-effect relationships and rational explanations.\n\n- **Key Contributions**:\n  - Secularization of history: Historians moved away from viewing history through a purely theological lens and began analyzing it through the frameworks of politics, economics, and society.\n  - Progress as a central theme: Enlightenment thinkers believed that history charted the progress of humanity, particularly through advancements in knowledge, technology, and governance.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **The Scientific Revolution (16th\u201318th Century)**\nThe Scientific Revolution introduced the scientific method, which emphasized evidence, observation, and hypothesis testing. This approach influenced historians to treat history as a process of inquiry based on evidence rather than relying on tradition or authority.\n\n- **Impact on History**:\n  - Historians adopted more systematic methods for verifying historical accounts.\n  - Chronology became more precise, as advances in astronomy (e.g., the Gregorian calendar) and archaeology allowed for more accurate dating of events.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **19th-Century Historicism and Professionalization**\nBy the 19th century, history became a professional academic discipline, grounded in rigorous methods of research and analysis. German historian Leopold von Ranke is often credited with founding the modern discipline of history. He introduced the principle of \"history as it actually happened\" (*wie es eigentlich gewesen*), emphasizing primary sources and objective analysis.\n\n- **Key Developments**:\n  - Historical methods: Ranke stressed critical evaluation of source materials, distinguishing between primary and secondary sources.\n  - National histories: The 19th century saw the rise of nationalist movements, which influenced many historians to write histories focused on the development of nations.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **20th-Century Developments in Historical Theory**\nThe 20th century saw further diversification in how history was approached, with the emergence of new schools of thought and methodologies:\n\n- **Annales School**: Founded in France, this school of thought emphasized long-term social, economic, and cultural structures over individual events.\n- **Marxist Historiography**: Focused on class struggles and the role of economic systems in shaping history, as inspired by Karl Marx.\n- **Postmodernism**: In the late 20th century, postmodernist thinkers challenged the idea of objective history, arguing that all historical narratives are shaped by cultural and ideological biases.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\nThe modern view of history is rooted in a gradual evolution from religious and mythical interpretations to a more analytical, evidence-based understanding. It integrates the Renaissance focus on human agency, the Enlightenment emphasis on reason and progress, and the scientific rigor of the 19th and 20th centuries. Today, history is a dynamic and interdisciplinary field, incorporating perspectives from sociology, anthropology, economics, and cultural studies to provide a comprehensive understanding of the past.","em":0,"f1":0.1111111111}
{"question":"when was the first book made into a movie","short_answers":["1924"],"long_answer":" In 1924 , Erich von Stroheim attempted a literal adaptation of Frank Norris 's novel McTeague with his moving picture Greed , and the resulting film was 91\u20442 hours long .

While it is difficult to pinpoint the absolute first book ever adapted into a movie, one of the earliest examples is **\"Cinderella\"**, based on the fairy tale by Charles Perrault. A short silent film version of this story, titled *Cendrillon* (French for \"Cinderella\"), was created in **1899** by the pioneering French filmmaker **Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s**. Though \"Cinderella\" is a folk tale rather than a modern novel, its adaptation demonstrates that filmmakers were inspired by literature right from the start of cinematic history.\n\nIf we consider adaptations of novels specifically, one of the earliest examples is **\"The Death of Ivan Ilyich\"**, a novella by Leo Tolstoy, which was adapted into a silent film titled *The Death of Ivan Ilyitch* in **1910**. Another early example is the adaptation of **Victor Hugo's novel \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\"** into a French silent film in **1905**.\n\nThe transition from page to screen was a natural development as early cinema sought narrative inspiration from already popular and established stories in literature. Many of these early films were short and silent due to technological limitations, but they laid the groundwork for the rich tradition of book-to-film adaptations that continues to this day.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

They are an example of special economic zones as seen in many countries . ","category":"Undetermined lexicons or references","judgment":"underspecified","reasoning":"The request is underspecified because the term \u201cfactories\u201d can refer to multiple parallel entities, such as manufacturing plants, assembly lines, or production facilities, and the phrase \u201cparts made in other countries\u201d lacks specificity regarding the type of parts or the geographic context. Both factors make the question underspecified.","model_short_answer":["Assembly plants","Maquiladoras"],"model_long_answer":"Factories that assemble parts made in other countries are typically referred to as **assembly plants** or sometimes as **contract manufacturers** or **maquiladoras** (in certain contexts). These factories are part of global supply chains, where different components are manufactured in various countries and then shipped to another facility for final assembly into a finished product.\n\n### Key Features of Such Factories:\n1. **Global Supply Chains**: \n   In modern manufacturing, companies often source parts and components from different countries to take advantage of lower costs, specialized expertise, or resource availability. For example:\n   - A car might have an engine manufactured in Japan, electronics from Germany, and seats made in Mexico, but all of these are assembled into a complete vehicle in a plant in the United States.\n   - Similarly, a smartphone might have processors from Taiwan, batteries from South Korea, and screens from China, but is assembled in Vietnam.\n\n2. **Cost Efficiency**:\n   Companies use this strategy to reduce production costs. For instance, parts may be produced in countries with the cheapest labor or material costs, while final assembly might occur closer to the target market to reduce shipping costs or meet regional trade agreements.\n\n3. **Trade Agreements and Tariffs**:\n   Many companies set up assembly plants in regions where they can benefit from favorable trade agreements or avoid tariffs. For example:\n   - Under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), many assembly operations occur in Mexico to take advantage of lower labor costs while adhering to trade rules that allow products to enter the United States or Canada tariff-free.\n\n4. **Maquiladoras**: \n   A specific example is the maquiladora system in Mexico. These are factories near the US-Mexico border where components are imported duty-free, assembled into finished products, and then exported (often back to the U.S.). This system has been a significant feature of North American manufacturing since the 1960s.\n\n5. **Industries Using Assembly Plants**:\n   This practice is common in various industries, such as:\n   - **Automotive**: Automakers like Ford, Toyota, and Volkswagen have assembly plants worldwide.\n   - **Electronics**: Companies like Apple and Samsung rely on assembly plants in countries like China, Vietnam, and India.\n   - **Apparel**: Clothing brands often source fabrics and components from one country and assemble the garments in another.\n\n### Examples of Global Assembly:\n- **Apple Inc.**: Apple designs its products in the U.S., sources components from countries like Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, and assembles them in China (primarily through contractors like Foxconn).\n- **Toyota**: Toyota manufactures parts in various countries but has assembly plants in the United States, Canada, and Mexico to produce vehicles for the North American market.\n- **Boeing**: Boeing sources airplane parts globally (e.g., wings from Japan, fuselage sections from Italy) and assembles the planes in the United States.\n\n### Advantages of Global Assembly:\n- **Lower Costs**: By outsourcing manufacturing to countries with lower labor or production costs, companies save money.\n- **Access to Specialized Skills**: Certain regions excel in manufacturing specific components, ensuring high-quality parts.\n- **Flexibility and Scalability**: Companies can adjust production across multiple locations to meet demand.\n\n### Challenges of Global Assembly:\n- **Supply Chain Disruptions**: Events like the COVID-19 pandemic or geopolitical tensions can disrupt the flow of parts between countries.\n- **Environmental Concerns**: Shipping parts across the globe increases carbon emissions.\n- **Ethical Issues**: Differences in labor laws and working conditions can lead to exploitation in some regions.\n\nIn summary, factories that assemble parts from other countries represent the interconnectedness of the global economy. They illustrate how industries leverage international resources, labor, and expertise to produce goods efficiently and cost-effectively.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

This technology ensures that write and erase cycles are distributed evenly across all memory cells, which helps prolong the lifespan of the drive.\n\nAdditionally, many drives include **spare cells** to replace worn-out cells, further extending the usable life of the device.\n\n### Practical Lifespan of a Flash Drive\nThe practical lifespan of a flash drive depends not only on its P\/E cycle rating but also on how frequently data is written to and erased from it. For example:\n- If you write 10GB of data daily to a 32GB flash drive with 1,000 P\/E cycles, the drive could last several years before reaching its limit.\n- Conversely, if the flash drive is used for occasional storage and not for constant writing, it could last decades.\n\n### Summary\nFlash drives can handle **hundreds to thousands of writes**, depending on the type of flash memory:\n- **SLC:** Up to 1,000,000 writes (best for longevity).\n- **MLC:** Up to 10,000 writes.\n- **TLC:** Up to 3,000 writes.\n- **QLC:** Up to 1,000 writes (lowest endurance).\n\nFor most casual users, a typical flash drive will last for many years of normal usage, as the number of writes required for everyday tasks usually falls well below the endurance limit. If you need a high-endurance flash drive for frequent writing, consider investing in **SLC-based or industrial-grade drives**.","em":0,"f1":0.1714285714}
{"question":"who in germany signed the treaty of versailles","short_answers":["Gustav Bauer"],"long_answer":" In June 1919 , the Allies declared that war would resume if the German government did not sign the treaty they had agreed to among themselves . The government headed by Philipp Scheidemann was unable to agree on a common position , and Scheidemann himself resigned rather than agree to sign the treaty . Gustav Bauer , the head of the new government , sent a telegram stating his intention to sign the treaty if certain articles were withdrawn , including Articles 227 , 230 and 231 . In response , the Allies issued an ultimatum stating that Germany would have to accept the treaty or face an invasion of Allied forces across the Rhine within 24 hours . On 23 June , Bauer capitulated and sent a second telegram with a confirmation that a German delegation would arrive shortly to sign the treaty . On 28 June 1919 , the fifth anniversary of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand ( the immediate impetus for the war ) , the peace treaty was signed . The treaty had clauses ranging from war crimes , the prohibition on the merging of Austria with Germany without the consent of the League of Nations , freedom of navigation on major European rivers , to the returning of a Koran to the king of Hedjaz . ","category":"Undetermined lexicons or references","judgment":"underspecified","reasoning":"The request is underspecified because the Treaty of Versailles was not signed by Germany, as it was the defeated nation. The treaty was signed by the Allied Powers (e.g., the U.S., UK, France) on behalf of the League of Nations. The question incorrectly assumes Germany was a signatory, leading to a referential ambiguity. Additionally, the phrase \"who in Germany\" lacks clarity on whether it refers to the German delegation present or a misinterpretation of the treaty's signatories.","model_short_answer":["Johannes Bell","Hermann M\u00fcller"],"model_long_answer":"The Treaty of Versailles, signed on June 28, 1919, officially ended World War I and imposed harsh terms on Germany. On behalf of Germany, the treaty was signed by two German representatives: **Johannes Bell** and **Hermann M\u00fcller**.\n\n### Context:\nThe Treaty of Versailles was negotiated during the Paris Peace Conference, primarily by the Allied powers (the United States, Britain, France, and Italy). Germany was not allowed to participate in the negotiations, which led to the treaty being perceived as a \"Diktat\" (dictated peace) by many Germans. When the treaty was finalized, the German government had little choice but to sign it, as refusing to do so would have likely resulted in the continuation of military hostilities.\n\n### Who Were the German Signatories?\n\n1. **Johannes Bell**:\n   - Bell was a member of the Catholic Centre Party (Zentrum) and served as the Minister of Colonial Affairs in the government of Chancellor Philipp Scheidemann and later Chancellor Gustav Bauer. \n   - He was chosen to sign the treaty as a representative of the German government.\n\n2. **Hermann M\u00fcller**:\n   - M\u00fcller was a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs at the time.\n   - He later became Chancellor of Germany in 1920 and again from 1928 to 1930.\n\nBoth men were sent to Versailles to sign the treaty under the orders of the German government, which had reluctantly agreed to accept its terms. The decision to sign the treaty was highly controversial in Germany and contributed to political instability in the years that followed.\n\n### The Treaty\u2019s Impact on Germany:\nThe Treaty of Versailles imposed severe penalties on Germany, including:\n- **Territorial losses**: Germany lost significant territories, including Alsace-Lorraine (to France), parts of Prussia (to Poland), and all its overseas colonies.\n- **Military restrictions**: The German military was limited to 100,000 troops, and certain weapons, such as tanks and aircraft, were prohibited.\n- **Reparations**: Germany was required to pay substantial reparations to the Allied powers.\n- **War guilt clause**: Article 231 of the treaty placed full blame for the war on Germany, a provision that deeply humiliated the nation.\n\nThe treaty created widespread resentment in Germany and became a rallying point for nationalist politicians, including Adolf Hitler, who used the perceived injustices of Versailles as propaganda to gain support.\n\nIn summary, Johannes Bell and Hermann M\u00fcller signed the Treaty of Versailles on behalf of Germany, under immense pressure from the Allied powers and with great reluctance from the German government. The treaty had long-lasting consequences for Germany and the world.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

As the largest hot desert in the world, covering approximately 9.2 million square kilometers (3.6 million square miles), it plays a crucial role in shaping global ecosystems, human history, and regional economies. Here are some of the key aspects of its significance:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Environmental Importance**\n- **Global Climate Regulation**: \n   The Sahara Desert influences global weather and climate patterns. Dust storms originating in the Sahara carry vast amounts of mineral-rich dust across the Atlantic Ocean, fertilizing the Amazon rainforest and enriching soils in the Americas. This process is vital for the global ecosystem and nutrient cycles.\n\n- **Biodiversity**: \n   Although it appears barren, the Sahara is home to unique plant and animal species adapted to extreme conditions, such as the fennec fox, Saharan cheetah, and desert-adapted rodents and reptiles. Its biodiversity, though limited, is essential for studying adaptation and resilience in extreme environments.\n\n- **Solar Energy Potential**: \n   With its vast expanse and high levels of sunshine, the Sahara has immense potential for solar energy production. Projects like the Desertec initiative have explored harnessing the desert's solar energy to provide renewable power for Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Historical and Cultural Significance**\n- **Cradle of Human Civilization**: \n   The Sahara has been home to human populations for thousands of years, and archaeological evidence shows that prehistoric humans lived in the region when it was a lush, green savanna (approximately 10,000 years ago). Rock art in sites like Tassili n'Ajjer in Algeria preserves evidence of early human life and cultures.\n\n- **Trade and Commerce**: \n   The Sahara was historically a major trade route, connecting sub-Saharan Africa with North Africa and the Mediterranean. Camel caravans facilitated the trans-Saharan trade, carrying gold, salt, ivory, and slaves between regions, which contributed to the rise of powerful medieval empires like Mali and Songhai.\n\n- **Cultural Diversity**: \n   The desert is home to various ethnic groups, including the Tuareg, Berbers, and other nomadic communities, who have adapted unique ways of life to survive in the harsh environment. Their languages, music, and traditions are a vital part of the region's heritage.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Economic Resources**\n- **Mineral Wealth**: \n   The Sahara holds vast reserves of valuable natural resources, including oil, natural gas, phosphates, and uranium. Countries like Algeria, Libya, and Mauritania have benefited economically from the exploitation of these resources, although this has also led to environmental concerns and geopolitical tensions.\n\n- **Salt Deposits**: \n   Historically, salt was a \u201cwhite gold\u201d in trans-Saharan trade due to its importance in preserving food and as a dietary necessity. Even today, salt extraction continues in areas like the Taoudenni salt mines in Mali.\n\n- **Tourism**: \n   The Sahara attracts adventurers and tourists drawn to its stunning landscapes, including sand dunes, oases, and prehistoric rock art. Regions like the Erg Chebbi dunes in Morocco and the Siwa Oasis in Egypt are popular destinations.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Geopolitical and Strategic Importance**\n- **Crossroads of Continents**:\n   The Sahara acts as a natural barrier between North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa, influencing migration, trade, and cultural exchange. It has long been a geopolitical frontier, shaping the relationships between different regions and peoples.\n\n- **Security and Conflict**: \n   In recent years, parts of the Sahara have become hotspots for conflict, including insurgencies and terrorism. Groups such as al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) have exploited the desert's vast, ungoverned spaces, posing challenges for regional stability and international security.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Scientific Research and Exploration**\n   - The Sahara is a key location for studying climate change and desertification. Its history of transformation from a fertile savanna to an arid desert provides insights into long-term climate cycles and human impact on the environment.\n   - The discovery of ancient fossils and meteorites in the Sahara has helped scientists understand the history of life on Earth and the solar system.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe Sahara Desert is more than just a vast expanse of sand; it is an ecologically, historically, and economically vital region. Its role in global systems, human history, and resource development underscores its importance. However, challenges such as desertification, climate change, and political instability continue to affect the region, requiring careful management to preserve its unique ecological and cultural heritage.","em":0,"f1":0.2372881356}

Accounts receivable (AR) refers to the amounts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services delivered on credit. The information about AR is typically derived from **invoices, contracts, and customer account records**. Here's a breakdown of the key sources of information for accounts receivable:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Invoices**\n   - When a company sells goods or services on credit, it issues an **invoice** to the customer. The invoice contains details such as:\n     - The amount due\n     - Payment terms (e.g., net 30 days)\n     - Invoice date\n     - Customer name and contact details\n     - Description of products or services sold\n   - Invoices are the primary document that creates the accounts receivable entry in the company's accounting system.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Sales Order Records**\n   - Sales orders or contracts initiated by customers help track the terms of the sale. These records include:\n     - Details of the items or services requested\n     - Agreed-upon pricing\n     - Delivery schedule\n     - Payment terms\n   - Once the sale is fulfilled, the sales order is matched with the invoice to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Customer Account Information**\n   - Each customer typically has an account in the company's accounting or enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. These accounts track:\n     - Credit terms extended to the customer\n     - Outstanding balances\n     - Payment history\n     - Credit limits\n   - This data ensures the company maintains proper records of what each customer owes.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Accounting Records**\n   - Accounting systems (e.g., QuickBooks, SAP, Oracle) maintain a **general ledger** that includes accounts receivable as an asset account. The general ledger is updated when:\n     - A sale is made on credit\n     - A payment is received\n     - Adjustments (e.g., discounts, write-offs) are applied\n   - These systems generate financial reports, such as the **accounts receivable aging report**, which categorizes receivables based on how long they\u2019ve been outstanding.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Credit Policies and Agreements**\n   - The terms agreed upon in a company\u2019s **credit policy** and any signed credit agreements with customers specify the conditions under which credit is extended. These documents are essential sources of information for managing accounts receivable effectively.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Payment Receipts**\n   - When customers make payments (via cash, check, or electronic transfer), receipts are issued, and the accounts receivable balance is reduced accordingly. These receipts help reconcile the outstanding amounts and ensure accurate records.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Customer Communication**\n   - Records of communication with customers, such as email correspondence or call logs, can serve as a secondary source of information. For example:\n     - Confirmations of delivery\n     - Disputes over invoices\n     - Requests for payment extensions\n   - These communications may affect how accounts receivable are recorded or managed.\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Audit Trails**\n   - An audit trail is a chronological record of all financial transactions related to accounts receivable. This includes:\n     - Initial sales transactions\n     - Adjustments like refunds, discounts, or bad debt write-offs\n     - Payments and settlements\n   - These trails help ensure accuracy and compliance with financial regulations.\n\n---\n\n### Why is Accurate AR Information Important?\nMaintaining accurate and up-to-date information about accounts receivable is critical for a business because:\n   - It impacts **cash flow management** by showing how much money is expected to come in and when.\n   - It helps assess the **creditworthiness** of customers and manage credit risk.\n   - It supports the preparation of financial statements, such as the **balance sheet** and **income statement**, showing the company\u2019s financial health.\n   - It aids in identifying overdue payments and helps in **collections efforts**.\n\nBy keeping track of these sources of information and ensuring proper record-keeping, businesses can manage their accounts receivable efficiently and minimize the risk of bad debts.","em":0,"f1":0.4}

It remains one of the most iconic songs of the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\n### Inspiration and Background:\nNorman Greenbaum, who was raised Jewish, wrote the song despite not being a Christian. He was inspired to write it after watching a television program about gospel music. The uplifting and spiritual themes of gospel music resonated with him, and he tried to create a song with a similar vibe. The lyrics reflect Greenbaum's vision of a peaceful afterlife and a connection with spirituality, even though his approach was more universal and not tied to any particular religion.\n\n### Style and Impact:\n*\"Spirit in the Sky\"* is known for its distinctive fuzz guitar riff, handclaps, and Greenbaum's unique vocal delivery. The song is often categorized as a blend of **psychedelic rock, gospel, and folk rock**, and its memorable opening guitar riff has made it a classic. Despite being a one-hit wonder (Greenbaum never achieved the same level of success with subsequent releases), the song has endured as a cultural touchstone.\n\nIt has been widely used in movies, TV shows, and commercials, and has been covered by numerous artists, including Gareth Gates, Doctor and the Medics, and the Kentucky Headhunters.

It indicates that the glass has been officially tested and certified to hold the correct volume of liquid \u2014 typically a pint (568 milliliters in the UK) \u2014 in compliance with the Measuring Instruments Directive (MID) and other legal metrology regulations. This ensures that customers receive the quantity of drink they are paying for.\n\n### Breakdown of the \"M Number\" Meaning:\n1. **The \"M\" Letter**: The \"M\" stands for \"metrology,\" the science of accurate measurement. It signifies that the glass has been inspected and approved for use in licensed establishments, such as pubs and bars.\n\n2. **The Number Following the \"M\"**: The number represents the year in which the glass was certified. For example, \"M22\" would mean the glass was certified in 2022. This helps track the certification and ensures that the glass complies with current regulations.\n\n3. **The CE Mark**: Often, you'll also find a \"CE\" mark near the \"M\" or incorporated into the same marking. The CE marking confirms that the glass complies with European Union legislation for measurement instruments.\n\n4. **Other Symbols**: There may also be a crown symbol, depending on when and where the glass was made. Historically, pint glasses in the UK were stamped with a crown as a symbol of government approval. However, this was largely replaced by the CE marking after the introduction of the MID in 2006. Some glasses may still feature a decorative crown, but it is no longer a legal requirement.\n\n### Why It\u2019s Important:\n- The markings ensure fair trade practices. When you order a pint of beer, you should receive exactly one pint, not less.\n- It provides trust and transparency between businesses and customers.\n- It ensures that establishments comply with trading standards laws.\n\n### Legal Enforcement:\nIn the UK, it is illegal for pubs and bars to serve alcohol in improperly measured glasses. Trading Standards officers may inspect businesses to ensure they are using correctly marked and certified glasses.\n\nIf you see a pint glass with an \"M number,\" you can feel confident that it meets the legal requirements for serving alcohol in the UK or EU.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

In simpler terms, it tells us how many independent movements are possible within the system.\n\n### General Formula for Degrees of Freedom\nTo calculate the degrees of freedom for a planar mechanism, we typically use **Gr\u00fcbler's equation**, which is:\n\n\\[\nF = 3(n - 1) - 2j - h\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( F \\): Degrees of freedom of the mechanism.\n- \\( n \\): Total number of links (including the fixed link).\n- \\( j \\): Total number of lower pairs (i.e., revolute or prismatic joints).\n- \\( h \\): Total number of higher pairs (e.g., cam or gear pairs).\n\n### Explanation of Terms:\n1. **Links (\\(n\\))**:\n   A link is any rigid body in the mechanism. This includes moving links and the fixed frame or ground.\n\n2. **Lower Pairs (\\(j\\))**:\n   These are joints with surface contact that allow relative motion. Examples include:\n   - Revolute (pin) joints: Allow rotational motion.\n   - Prismatic (sliding) joints: Allow translational motion.\n\n3. **Higher Pairs (\\(h\\))**:\n   These are joints with point or line contact and more complex motion, such as cams and gears.\n\n4. **The Constant \u20183\u2019 in the Formula**:\n   In a planar mechanism, each rigid body has three potential degrees of freedom: two translational (in the \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-directions) and one rotational (about an axis perpendicular to the plane).\n\n### Example: Four-Bar Mechanism\nLet\u2019s apply the formula to a simple four-bar mechanism:\n- Total links (\\(n\\)) = 4 (three moving links + one fixed link).\n- Lower pairs (\\(j\\)) = 4 (four revolute joints, each connecting two links).\n- Higher pairs (\\(h\\)) = 0 (there are no cams or gears in this example).\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\nF = 3(n - 1) - 2j - h\n\\]\n\\[\nF = 3(4 - 1) - 2(4) - 0\n\\]\n\\[\nF = 9 - 8 = 1\n\\]\n\nThus, the four-bar mechanism has **1 degree of freedom**, meaning it requires only one independent input to control its motion.\n\n### General Observations:\n- A single rigid body in the plane has **3 degrees of freedom** (two translational and one rotational).\n- Adding constraints (like joints) reduces the degrees of freedom.\n- A mechanism with \\(F = 0\\) is a **structure** (completely stationary).\n- A mechanism with \\(F > 0\\) is capable of motion.\n\n### Special Cases:\n1. **Over-Constrained Mechanisms**:\n   If the number of constraints exceeds the required number, the mechanism might be immobile or redundant.\n\n2. **Under-Constrained Mechanisms**:\n   If the number of constraints is insufficient, the mechanism may have multiple degrees of freedom or move uncontrollably.\n\nUnderstanding degrees of freedom is crucial for designing mechanisms because it ensures that the system can perform the desired motion efficiently.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

The question conflates unrelated cultural references without clarifying the intended context or meaning, leaving the referent ambiguous.","model_short_answer":["There is no Batman and Robin episode in 'Only Fools and Horses,' but there is a famous scene in the episode 'Heroes and Villains' where Del Boy and Rodney dress up as Batman and Robin."],"model_long_answer":"The connection between Batman and Robin and *Only Fools and Horses* refers to a famous scene from the British sitcom *Only Fools and Horses*, rather than an actual episode featuring the superhero duo.\n\nThe scene in question occurs in the Christmas special titled **\"Heroes and Villains\"**, which originally aired on December 25, 1996. It is one of the most iconic moments in British television comedy history. The episode is part of the long-running and beloved sitcom *Only Fools and Horses*, created by John Sullivan, which follows the exploits of two brothers, Del Boy (Derek Trotter) and Rodney Trotter, as they try to make a fortune through various schemes in Peckham, London.\n\n### The Batman and Robin Scene\nIn *\"Heroes and Villains\"*, Del Boy and Rodney dress up as Batman and Robin to attend a fancy dress party hosted by their friend Boycie and his wife, Marlene. However, in a classic comedic twist, they discover upon arrival that the party is not actually fancy dress \u2014 it was meant to be a formal occasion. This misunderstanding leads to one of the show\u2019s most memorable moments.\n\nOn their way to the party, Del Boy and Rodney, still in their superhero costumes, come across a gang of muggers threatening a man in an alley. Their sudden appearance in full superhero attire causes the muggers to panic and flee, leaving the man stunned and grateful. The hilarious juxtaposition of the absurdity of two grown men dressed as Batman and Robin with the seriousness of the situation is what makes this scene such a classic.\n\n### Cultural Impact\nThe Batman and Robin scene has become one of the most famous moments from *Only Fools and Horses* and is often cited as a highlight of British comedy. The sight of Del Boy in his ill-fitting Batman costume and Rodney as a lanky Robin perfectly encapsulates the humor and charm of the series. The scene is also a great example of the show\u2019s ability to blend slapstick humor with heartwarming moments.\n\nThis episode, along with others from the series, helped solidify *Only Fools and Horses* as one of the greatest British sitcoms of all time. In 2004, the show was voted Britain\u2019s Best Sitcom in a poll conducted by the BBC.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to watch this iconic moment, the full *\"Heroes and Villains\"* episode is widely available on DVD and streaming platforms that feature *Only Fools and Horses*. It\u2019s a must-watch for fans of classic British comedy!","em":0,"f1":0.1666666667}

The two teams have a long and storied rivalry, but they haven't played each other since September 23, 2017, when Notre Dame defeated Michigan State 38\u201318 in East Lansing.\n\n### History of the Rivalry\nThe Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the Michigan State Spartans football programs have a rich history that dates back to their first meeting in 1897. They have faced off 79 times, with Notre Dame leading the all-time series 48\u201329\u20131. The rivalry is best remembered for the legendary 1966 \"Game of the Century,\" which ended in a 10\u201310 tie and ultimately contributed to Notre Dame's national championship that season.\n\n### Recent Developments\nThe rivalry became less frequent after Notre Dame joined the ACC in 2014 as a partial member for all sports except football. While Notre Dame remains independent in football, their scheduling agreements with the ACC limit their ability to schedule traditional rivals like Michigan State. Additionally, Michigan State plays in the Big Ten Conference, which has expanded its conference schedule, making non-conference matchups like this one more difficult to arrange.\n\n### Possibility of Future Matchups\nWhile nothing is currently scheduled, it\u2019s always possible that the schools could renew the rivalry in the future. Notre Dame frequently schedules games with traditional Midwest opponents, and Michigan State would be a logical choice for a marquee non-conference game. However, such games are typically scheduled years in advance, so fans may have to wait.\n\nIf you're following this rivalry closely, it\u2019s a good idea to keep an eye on announcements from both schools' athletic departments. College football schedules are often planned several years ahead, and any future matchups would likely be announced well in advance.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

The series follows the adventures of Chiro, a young boy who accidentally becomes the leader of a team of robot monkeys with superpowers. Together, they protect the futuristic planet Shuggazoom City from various villains, including the series' main antagonist, the Skeleton King.\n\nWhile the show itself was incredibly action-packed and had a strong fan base, there were no official *fighting games* directly based on the series released during its run. However, there are several ways the show and its characters might have intersected with gaming:\n\n### 1. **Potential for a Fighting Game**\nThe premise of \"Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!\" lends itself perfectly to a fighting game. The series features a diverse cast of characters with unique abilities:\n   - **Chiro**: The human protagonist with the \"Power Primate,\" granting him enhanced strength and agility.\n   - **Antauri**: The wise and calm black monkey, skilled in telekinesis and martial arts.\n   - **Sparks**: The energetic red monkey, who specializes in mechanics and wields electrical attacks.\n   - **Nova**: The tough yellow monkey, known for her incredible strength and explosive punches.\n   - **Gibson**: The blue monkey, a technological genius with advanced gadgets.\n   - **Otto**: The green monkey and the team's engineer, with creative and unconventional combat techniques.\n\nEach character's distinct fighting style and abilities could easily translate into a roster for a fighting game, similar to titles like *Super Smash Bros.*, *Street Fighter*, or *Power Rangers: Battle for the Grid*.\n\n### 2. **Fan Creations**\nAlthough no official fighting game exists, fans of the series have created fan art, concepts, and even custom mods for existing games featuring characters from the show. These fan-made tributes often imagine how the Hyperforce team would look and play in fighting game scenarios.\n\n### 3. **Crossover Possibility**\nGiven the show's inclusion in the Jetix lineup, a fighting game featuring multiple Jetix characters (like those from *Power Rangers*, *Digimon*, or *Yin Yang Yo!*) could have been a great opportunity to include the Hyperforce team. Unfortunately, no such crossover game was ever developed.\n\n### 4. **Online Flash Games**\nDuring the show's heyday, there were Flash-based browser games on the official Jetix website that featured the Hyperforce team. While these games were typically platformers or action-adventure mini-games rather than traditional fighting games, they did allow players to engage in combat as their favorite characters. Since Flash is now obsolete, these games are no longer available, but they remain a nostalgic part of the series' legacy.\n\n### 5. **Modern Game Development Possibilities**\nGiven the resurgence of interest in retro and cult-favorite animated shows, it\u2019s not impossible that \"Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!\" could inspire a nostalgic fighting game or crossover appearance in the future. Developers have been increasingly revisiting older IPs for games, as seen with titles like *Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl* or *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder\u2019s Revenge*.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile there are no official fighting games dedicated to \"Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!\", the show's rich characters and action-oriented premise make it a perfect candidate for such a game. Fans of the series have long imagined how the Hyperforce team would perform in a gaming environment, but for now, the idea remains a hopeful dream among the show's loyal fanbase.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

As of the most recent count, **Texas has 1,218 incorporated municipalities** (which include cities, towns, and villages). This data is based on the Texas Municipal League, which tracks incorporated places in the state.\n\n### How are cities defined in Texas?\nIn Texas, municipalities are categorized as either **general-law municipalities** or **home-rule municipalities**:\n1. **General-law municipalities**: These are smaller towns or cities that operate under the general laws of the state. They have limited governing authority and must adhere strictly to the powers granted by the Texas Constitution or state statutes. Most of the smaller municipalities fall under this category.\n2. **Home-rule municipalities**: These are larger cities (with populations of at least 5,000) that have adopted a home-rule charter. This allows them more governing flexibility, as long as their ordinances and laws do not conflict with state law. Major cities like Houston, Dallas, and Austin fall into this category.\n\n### Notable Statistics about Texas Cities:\n- The largest city in Texas is **Houston**, with a population of over 2.3 million people (2023 estimate), making it the fourth-largest city in the U.S.\n- The smallest incorporated city in Texas is **Los Ybanez**, with only about 20 residents.\n- Texas also has several fast-growing cities, such as **Frisco**, **McKinney**, and **Georgetown**, which have seen rapid population growth in recent years.\n\n### Urban vs. Rural Divide:\nWhile Texas has many urban centers, including **Fort Worth, San Antonio, El Paso,** and **Austin**, much of the state is still rural, with small towns and unincorporated communities scattered across its vast land area.\n\nIf you're interested in a specific city or want to explore the complete list, the Texas State Data Center or the Texas Municipal League is a great resource for up-to-date information.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

It could refer to a specific type of plant, animal, or natural feature, but without additional context or clarification, the referent is unclear.","model_short_answer":["Spanish moss"],"model_long_answer":"In the bayou, one of the most distinctive and iconic sights is the Spanish moss that hangs from the trees. Spanish moss (scientific name *Tillandsia usneoides*) is a type of epiphytic bromeliad, meaning that it grows on other plants (usually trees) without taking nutrients from them. It is not a true moss, despite its name, and it is not parasitic. Instead, Spanish moss absorbs water and nutrients from the air and rain through its leaves.\n\n### Characteristics of Spanish Moss\n- **Appearance**: Spanish moss has long, thread-like, gray-green tendrils that drape down from tree branches, creating an eerie, romantic, or mysterious aesthetic often associated with the Southern United States.\n- **Growth Habitat**: It thrives in warm, humid environments, which is why it is so commonly found in the bayous of Louisiana, Mississippi, and other areas in the southeastern United States. Bayous, with their slow-moving or still waters, high humidity, and moss-covered trees, provide an ideal environment for Spanish moss.\n- **Trees it Grows On**: It is most often seen hanging from live oaks (*Quercus virginiana*) and bald cypress trees (*Taxodium distichum*), both of which are common in bayous and wetlands.\n\n### Cultural and Ecological Significance\n- **Cultural Image**: Spanish moss is often associated with the mystique of the American South, particularly in settings like Louisiana's bayous and historic Southern plantations. Its ghostly, draping appearance has made it a symbol of Southern Gothic aesthetics in literature, film, and art.\n- **Wildlife Habitat**: Spanish moss provides shelter for various species of insects, birds, and bats. For example, birds often use it as nesting material.\n- **Human Uses**: Historically, Spanish moss was used as stuffing for mattresses, upholstery, and even car seats in the early 20th century. Today, it is sometimes used in floral arrangements and crafts.\n\n### Other Flora in Bayous\nIn addition to Spanish moss, the bayou is home to other plant species that thrive in its wet, swampy environment. These include water lilies, duckweed, cypress knees (the distinctive above-ground roots of bald cypress trees), and other aquatic plants.

Common answers include God, angels, or loved ones who have passed away."],"model_long_answer":"The concept of meeting someone at the gates of heaven varies widely depending on religious, cultural, and personal beliefs. In many traditions and depictions, the \"gates of heaven\" symbolize the entry point into the afterlife, often portrayed as a place where souls are judged or welcomed. Below is an explanation based on some common religious and cultural beliefs:\n\n### 1. **Christianity**\n   In Christian theology, the \"gates of heaven\" are often associated with Saint Peter. According to tradition, Saint Peter acts as the gatekeeper of heaven, as he was given the \"keys of the kingdom of heaven\" by Jesus (Matthew 16:19). Many depictions in Christian art and literature, including popular culture, imagine Saint Peter standing at the gates, determining whether a soul is allowed to enter based on their faith, deeds, and the state of their soul.\n\n   - **Judgment and Entry:** Some Christian denominations believe that individuals are judged by God immediately after death (the \"Particular Judgment\") or during the \"Final Judgment\" at the end of time. Saint Peter's role is more symbolic in this sense, as the ultimate judgment belongs to God.\n   - **Heavenly Welcome:** In many interpretations, those who have lived a virtuous life may be greeted warmly at the gates, sometimes by loved ones or angels.\n\n### 2. **Islam**\n   In Islamic tradition, there is no specific mention of Saint Peter or a figure guarding the gates of paradise (Jannah). Instead, it is believed that angels oversee the gates of paradise and hell. Good deeds, faith in Allah, and adherence to the teachings of Islam determine whether a soul is granted entry into Jannah. The Qur'an describes eight gates of paradise, each reserved for individuals who excel in particular virtues, such as charity, prayer, or fasting.\n\n   - **Welcoming Angels:** Angels are described as greeting the righteous as they enter paradise, saying, \"Peace be upon you. You have done well; so enter it to abide eternally therein\" (Qur'an 39:73).\n   - **Family and Friends:** In Jannah, believers are often described as being reunited with loved ones who also made it to paradise.\n\n### 3. **Judaism**\n   Judaism has less emphasis on the imagery of gates of heaven or a specific individual standing guard. The afterlife (Olam Ha-Ba) is not as clearly defined in Jewish scripture as it is in Christianity or Islam. Jewish belief focuses more on living a righteous life in the present world. Some Jewish teachings describe an afterlife where souls are judged by God, and the righteous are rewarded with closeness to God.\n\n### 4. **Other Beliefs**\n   - **Hinduism and Buddhism:** In Hindu and Buddhist traditions, the concept of heaven (Swarga or Nirvana) is different from the Abrahamic view. Entry into a heavenly realm is often linked to karma (actions) and dharma (moral duty). There is no specific figure \"guarding\" the gates, but celestial beings or deities may guide souls in their journey to the afterlife or through cycles of reincarnation.\n   - **Modern Spirituality and Near-Death Experiences:** Some people who have reported near-death experiences describe being met by loved ones, guides, or beings of light at the entrance to a heavenly space. These accounts are often personal and vary widely.\n\n### 5. **Popular Culture**\n   In popular culture, the image of Saint Peter standing at the pearly gates with a book (the \"Book of Life\") is a familiar trope. This imagery stems from Christian tradition but is often exaggerated or fictionalized. Sometimes, individuals are portrayed as meeting loved ones, angels, or even God at the gates.\n\n### Summary\nThe question of who you meet at the gates of heaven depends on your faith, worldview, or cultural beliefs. For many, it is a comforting thought that a loved one, a spiritual figure, or a divine being will welcome them. In essence, this symbolic \"meeting\" represents the transition into the afterlife, where a person's life and actions are acknowledged.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

Dick's 1962 novel of the same name, the films (referred to as \"the films\" or \"reels\" in the show) play a central role in the story and its exploration of alternate realities. These films, which are mysterious newsreel-style recordings, depict alternate versions of history where events unfold differently than they do in the dystopian world of the show. Understanding their significance requires unpacking their meaning within the context of the series' narrative, themes, and the multiverse theory.\n\n### **Context of the Show**\nThe series is set in an alternate timeline where the Axis powers (Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan) won World War II and divided the United States into territories they control. The Greater Nazi Reich occupies the eastern U.S., while the Japanese Pacific States govern the west, with a neutral zone in between. In this oppressive world, resistance movements fight for freedom, and the films become a symbol of hope and resistance.\n\n### **What Are the Films?**\nThe films are mysterious recordings that feature alternate realities. Many of them show a world in which the Allies won World War II, a direct contrast to the show's dystopian reality. These films are highly sought after by various factions, including the resistance, the Nazis, and the Japanese authorities, because they seem to hold the key to understanding the nature of reality and the possibility of changing it.\n\n#### **Key Characteristics of the Films:**\n1. **Depictions of Alternate Histories**: The films show what could have happened if events in history had unfolded differently. For example, some reels depict the Allies defeating the Axis powers, a world free of authoritarian regimes, or individuals making different choices that lead to different outcomes.\n   \n2. **Multiverse Implications**: The films suggest the existence of a multiverse\u2014a collection of parallel realities where every possibility plays out. This idea is central to the deeper science-fiction themes of the show.\n\n3. **Reality-Bending Nature**: The films defy explanation within the show's world. They are hard evidence of alternate timelines, which confounds the Nazis and Japanese, who hold rigid ideological views. The films are also unsettling because they challenge the characters' understanding of their world and their agency within it.\n\n4. **Produced by Travelers**: It is revealed that the films are created by individuals who can \"travel\" between parallel universes. These travelers, including the enigmatic \"Man in the High Castle\" (Hawthorne Abendsen), gather and share these films as a way to inspire resistance and reveal the truth about reality.\n\n### **Symbolic Meaning of the Films**\nThe films carry deep symbolic significance within the narrative:\n1. **Hope and Resistance**: For the resistance fighters, the films are proof that their dystopian reality isn't the only possibility. They inspire hope that a better world can exist and motivate them to fight against tyranny.\n   \n2. **The Power of Knowledge**: The films represent forbidden knowledge that challenges the totalitarian regimes' control over their subjects. Both the Nazis and the Japanese authorities fear the films because they undermine the narrative that their victory in World War II was inevitable and absolute.\n\n3. **Moral Choices and Free Will**: Many of the films show characters making different decisions that lead to vastly different outcomes. This reinforces the theme that individual choices matter and that people have the power to shape their destinies, even in the face of overwhelming oppression.\n\n4. **Truth vs. Propaganda**: In a world dominated by propaganda, the films serve as a counter-narrative. They show an unvarnished and authentic view of alternative possibilities, challenging the lies perpetuated by the ruling regimes.\n\n### **The Man in the High Castle**\nThe title character, Hawthorne Abendsen, is the \"Man in the High Castle,\" who is initially believed to be the source of the films. In the series, he resides in a fortified home and possesses many of the reels. Abendsen plays a pivotal role in curating and disseminating the films, though it is eventually revealed that he is not the sole creator of them. Instead, the films come from travelers across dimensions, who collect and share these alternate histories.\n\n### **Why Are the Films Important to the Nazis and Japanese?**\nThe films are viewed as both a threat and an opportunity by the ruling powers:\n1. **The Nazis**: The Nazis view the films as dangerous because they challenge the idea of their supremacy and the inevitability of their victory. However, high-ranking Nazi officials like John Smith and Heinrich Himmler are also intrigued by the films' implications, especially as the series explores the Nazi interest in harnessing multiverse travel for their own ends.\n   \n2. **The Japanese**: The Japanese authorities, particularly Trade Minister Nobusuke Tagomi, have a more spiritual and philosophical reaction to the films. Tagomi, who himself experiences travel between dimensions, sees the films as a window into the interconnectedness of all things and the possibility of redemption.\n\n### **The Films and Alternate Realities**\nA key revelation in the series is that the films are evidence of a multiverse, where infinite realities exist side by side. Some characters, like Juliana Crain, discover that they have counterparts in other realities and begin to understand the broader implications of their actions across timelines. The films ultimately suggest that the dystopian reality of the show is just one of many possibilities, and that it might be possible to shift between realities\u2014or even change the course of history.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe films in *The Man in the High Castle* are more than just plot devices; they are central to the show's exploration of themes such as resistance, free will, and the nature of reality. They symbolize hope in a world of despair, challenge oppressive ideologies, and point to the possibility of alternate outcomes and redemption. By introducing the concept of the multiverse, the films expand the narrative from a story about an alternate history to a broader meditation on the power of human choice and the infinite potential of the universe.","em":0,"f1":0.1714285714}
{"question":"when did they stop cigarette advertising on television","short_answers":["January 2, 1971"],"long_answer":" After World War II , cigarette companies advertised frequently on television programs . To combat this move by the cigarette companies , the Federal Communications Commission required television stations to air anti-smoking advertisements at no cost to the organizations providing such advertisements . In 1970 , Congress took their anti-smoking initiative one step further and passed the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act , banning the advertising of cigarettes on television and radio starting on January 2 , 1971 . After the television ban , most cigarette advertising took place in magazines , newspapers , and on billboards . However , in 1999 all cigarette billboard advertisements were replaced with anti-smoking messages , with some of these anti-smoking messages playing parodies of cigarette companies advertising figures and slogans . Since 1984 , cigarette companies have also been forced to place Surgeon 's General warnings on all cigarette packs and advertisements because of the passing of the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act . Restrictions on cigarette companies became even tighter in 2010 with the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act . The act prohibits tobacco companies from sponsoring sports , music , and other cultural events and also prevents the display of their logos or products on T - shirts , hats , or other apparel . The constitutionality of both this act and the Food and Drug Administration 's new graphic cigarette warning labels are being questioned under cigarette companies ' first amendment rights .

Without this context, the answer cannot be accurately determined.","model_short_answer":["January 2, 1971"],"model_long_answer":"Cigarette advertising on television in the United States was officially banned as of **January 2, 1971**, under the **Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969**. This legislation was signed into law by President Richard Nixon on **April 1, 1970**, and it prohibited cigarette advertisements from being broadcast on both television and radio.\n\nThe last cigarette commercial aired just before the ban went into effect. It was for **Virginia Slims** and was broadcast at 11:59 p.m. on January 1, 1971, during \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.\"\n\n### Context Behind the Ban:\nThe move to ban cigarette advertising on TV and radio was part of a larger public health campaign to reduce smoking and its associated health risks, which were becoming increasingly well-documented at the time. In 1964, the **U.S. Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health** had definitively linked smoking with serious health issues like lung cancer and heart disease, prompting widespread concern.\n\nIn response, Congress passed the **Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of 1965**, which required health warnings on cigarette packaging and advertisements. However, by the late 1960s, public health advocates argued that stricter measures were needed, as television was a highly influential medium. The 1969 Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act went further by banning TV and radio ads entirely.\n\n### Impact of the Ban:\n- Tobacco companies shifted their advertising budgets toward other forms of media, such as magazines, newspapers, and outdoor billboards, and heavily invested in point-of-sale advertising and sponsorships (e.g., sports events like NASCAR).\n- Anti-smoking campaigns, such as public service announcements warning of the dangers of smoking, began to fill the void left by tobacco advertising.\n- The restriction on TV and radio ads was a landmark step in regulating tobacco products and has been credited with helping to reduce smoking rates in the U.S. over time.\n\n### Global Perspective:\nOther countries followed suit in banning cigarette advertising on television over the years. For example:\n- The **United Kingdom** banned television cigarette ads in **1965** (with the ban taking effect in 1966).\n- In **Australia**, cigarette ads were banned on TV and radio in **1976**.\n- The **European Union** implemented a directive in **2003** that banned all forms of tobacco advertising in broadcast media across its member states.\n\nThis ban on cigarette advertising on TV and radio was one of the first major victories in the fight against tobacco-related illnesses and marked a turning point in public health policy.","em":1,"f1":1.0}

Substituting \"Sam Hill\" allowed speakers to express strong emotion without offending others. This fits into a broader pattern of euphemisms for swear words, such as \"darn\" for \"damn\" or \"heck\" for \"hell.\"\n\n2. **Sam Hill as a Real Person:**\n   Another theory suggests that the phrase may have been inspired by a real person, though there is little definitive evidence to tie the phrase to any one individual. One figure often mentioned is Samuel Hill, a 19th-century surveyor and politician from New England. He was known for his fiery temper and colorful language, which might have popularized his name as an exclamation. However, this connection remains speculative.\n\n3. **Early Literary References:**\n   The first recorded use of \"Sam Hill\" as an expression dates back to the early 19th century. One of the earliest written examples appears in the *New England Farmer* in 1839: \"What the Sam Hill is that?\" This suggests that the phrase had already entered common usage by this time, though its exact origins are not documented.\n\n4. **Popularization in American English:**\n   The phrase gained widespread popularity in the United States during the 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in rural areas and among older generations. Over time, it became part of American folk speech, used as a mild and humorous way to express astonishment or confusion.\n\n### Modern Usage\nToday, \"What in the Sam Hill\" is considered somewhat old-fashioned and is less commonly heard, though it still appears in nostalgic or humorous contexts. It is often associated with rural or Western American English and is sometimes used to evoke a sense of Americana.\n\nIn summary, the origins of \"What in the Sam Hill\" likely stem from its use as a euphemism for \"hell,\" with possible connections to a real person or cultural references from the 19th century. While its exact beginnings remain murky, the phrase has endured as a quirky and distinctly American expression.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

Johnson won the state during his landslide victory over Republican candidate Barry Goldwater. Johnson's success in Nebraska that year reflected the widespread popularity of his policies, including his support for civil rights legislation and the \"Great Society\" programs, as well as Goldwater's perceived extremism by many voters.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that Nebraska has a unique system for allocating its electoral votes in presidential elections. Unlike most states, which use a winner-takes-all system, Nebraska and Maine split their electoral votes. Nebraska allocates two electoral votes to the statewide winner and one electoral vote to the winner of each of its three congressional districts.\n\nUnder this system, Nebraska has occasionally awarded one electoral vote to a Democratic candidate. For example:\n- In **2008**, Barack Obama won the electoral vote from Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District (centered around Omaha), even though the state as a whole voted Republican.\n- In **2020**, Joe Biden also won the electoral vote from the 2nd Congressional District, while the rest of the state voted for Donald Trump.\n\nThis shows that while Nebraska is predominantly a Republican stronghold, certain urban areas, particularly Omaha, have occasionally supported Democratic candidates in recent elections.","em":1,"f1":1.0}

Without clarifying which is intended, the question remains underspecified.","model_short_answer":["John Smith"],"model_long_answer":"Captain **John Smith** took control of Jamestown in 1608 and implemented new rules that required everyone in the colony to work in order to ensure its survival. Jamestown, founded in 1607 in Virginia, was the first permanent English settlement in North America, but it faced severe challenges in its early years, including disease, starvation, and poor planning.\n\nWhen Smith assumed leadership of the colony, he found that many settlers were unwilling to work. They were either focused on searching for gold or felt entitled to rely on supplies sent from England rather than contributing to the colony's survival. To address this issue and prevent the settlement from collapsing, Smith imposed a strict rule: **\"He that will not work shall not eat.\"** This policy was intended to ensure that everyone contributed to essential tasks, such as farming, building shelters, and securing resources, rather than depending on the labor of others.\n\nSmith's leadership and enforcement of discipline played a key role in stabilizing the colony during its early hardships. He also developed a trade relationship with the local Powhatan Confederacy, led by Chief Powhatan, which helped provide food and resources to the struggling settlers. However, in 1609, Smith was injured in a gunpowder accident and was forced to return to England, leaving Jamestown without his strong leadership. After his departure, the colony endured a period of extreme hardship known as the **\"Starving Time\"** during the winter of 1609\u20131610, when many settlers died of starvation and disease.\n\nJohn Smith's contributions to Jamestown are significant because his leadership and work ethic helped lay the foundation for the settlement's eventual survival and growth.

At some schools , where students begin meeting patients early in their education , the white coat ceremony is held before the first year begins . It is an example of a matriculation . ","category":"Undetermined perspective or granularity","judgment":"underspecified","reasoning":"The request is underspecified because the phrase \u201cwhite coat\u201d can refer to multiple parallel events, such as the symbolic wearing of the white coat during graduation or the initial wearing of the white coat during the first year of studies. Without specifying which event is meant, the question remains underspecified.","model_short_answer":["Typically at the beginning of the program during a White Coat Ceremony."],"model_long_answer":"In pharmacy school, students typically receive their white coats during a **White Coat Ceremony**, which is a symbolic event marking their entry into the professional phase of their education and their commitment to the pharmacy profession. The timing of this ceremony can vary depending on the school, but it usually occurs **early in the program**, often during the first year of pharmacy school (commonly referred to as the P1 year in a Doctor of Pharmacy, or PharmD, program).\n\n### What is the White Coat Ceremony?\nThe White Coat Ceremony is a tradition in many health-related professional programs, including medicine, nursing, and pharmacy. During the ceremony, students are presented with a white coat, which symbolizes their entrance into the healthcare field and their responsibilities as future professionals. For pharmacy students, it emphasizes their commitment to patient care, ethical standards, and lifelong learning.\n\n### When Does It Happen in Pharmacy School?\nThe timing of the white coat ceremony typically depends on the structure of the program:\n1. **Traditional PharmD Programs**: In a standard 4-year pharmacy program (typically following 2 years of prerequisite undergraduate coursework), the White Coat Ceremony often takes place within the first semester or the first few months of the program. For example, some schools hold the ceremony within the first few weeks as part of orientation, while others may wait until students complete an introductory pharmacy course.\n2. **Accelerated or Combined Programs**: In accelerated programs (e.g., 3-year PharmD programs) or combined bachelor's\/PharmD pathways, the ceremony may still occur during the first year but may be adjusted based on the program's schedule.\n3. **Before Clinical Rotations**: Some schools hold the ceremony at the transition point between classroom learning and the start of clinical rotations or experiential learning, though this is less common as compared to the early P1 year ceremonies.\n\n### Why Is the White Coat Ceremony Important?\nThe ceremony serves as a formal introduction to the profession and highlights the ethical responsibilities pharmacy students will undertake. Many schools also include an oath or pledge during the event, where students commit to upholding the values of the profession, such as honesty, integrity, and patient-centered care. It is often attended by faculty, family, and peers to celebrate this milestone.\n\n### What Happens After the White Coat Ceremony?\nAfter receiving their white coats, pharmacy students begin their formal education in pharmaceutical sciences and patient care practices. The white coat is often used in **laboratory settings, simulations, and during introductory experiential learning**. However, it is important to note that the white coat does not signify full licensure as a pharmacist; students must complete their PharmD curriculum, pass licensure exams (like the NAPLEX), and meet state-specific requirements to become licensed pharmacists.\n\nIf you are planning to start pharmacy school soon, you can check with your specific program for details about their White Coat Ceremony, as traditions and timing can vary between schools.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

Hurricane Lee was notable for its large size, with tropical-storm-force winds extending hundreds of miles from its center.\n\nBefore Hurricane Lee, the last hurricane to make direct landfall in New England was **Hurricane Bob** in **August 1991**. Bob struck Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts as a Category 2 hurricane, causing significant damage, particularly in coastal areas, with high winds, storm surge, and flooding.\n\n### Hurricanes and Tropical Systems in New England\nAlthough hurricanes and tropical storms are less common in New England compared to the southeastern U.S., the region is still vulnerable due to its coastline and geography. New England hurricanes often occur during late summer and early fall, when the Atlantic hurricane season is at its peak.\n\nSome of the most historic hurricanes to hit New England include:\n- **The Great New England Hurricane of 1938**: A Category 3 hurricane at landfall, this storm caused widespread devastation across Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts, killing over 600 people.\n- **Hurricane Carol (1954)**: A Category 3 hurricane that caused significant damage to New England, particularly in Rhode Island and Connecticut.\n- **Hurricane Gloria (1985)**: Made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane, causing power outages and damage in Connecticut and other parts of New England.\n\nWhile hurricanes are less frequent in New England, the region can still experience significant impacts from tropical cyclones, including heavy rain, wind damage, and coastal flooding.

The war was primarily fought over the governance of England and the balance of power between the monarchy and Parliament, as well as underlying religious tensions.\n\n### The Two Sides\n#### **1. Royalists (Cavaliers):**\n- The Royalists supported **King Charles I** and his belief in the divine right of kings, which held that the monarch was chosen by God and had absolute authority.\n- They wanted to maintain traditional monarchical powers and opposed significant parliamentary control.\n- The Royalists were generally supported by aristocrats, landowners, and those loyal to the Church of England.\n\n#### **2. Parliamentarians (Roundheads):**\n- The Parliamentarians opposed the king's autocratic rule and sought to limit his powers. They wanted more influence for Parliament in governance.\n- Many were Puritans or other Protestant reformers who opposed the perceived Catholic-leaning policies of Charles I and the Church of England.\n- Support came from merchants, the middle class, and some regions of England, particularly in urban areas like London and the southeast.\n\n---\n\n### Causes of the English Civil War:\n1. **Religion:**\n   - There was significant tension between Protestants and Catholics, and within Protestantism itself (e.g., Puritans vs. Anglicanism).\n   - Charles I\u2019s marriage to a Catholic princess (Henrietta Maria of France) and his perceived favoritism toward Catholicism alienated many English Protestants.\n   - The king's attempts to impose Anglican practices on Scotland (which was largely Presbyterian) led to the Bishops' Wars (1639\u20131640), which drained the treasury and increased discontent.\n\n2. **Power Struggle Between the King and Parliament:**\n   - Charles I frequently dissolved Parliament when it challenged his authority. He ruled without Parliament from 1629 to 1640, a period known as the **Personal Rule** or the \"Eleven Years' Tyranny.\"\n   - To fund his government during this time, Charles imposed controversial taxes (like **ship money**) without Parliament's consent, angering many.\n   - In 1640, Charles was forced to recall Parliament to raise funds to deal with a Scottish rebellion, but this led to further conflicts instead of cooperation.\n\n3. **Economic and Social Issues:**\n   - Economic hardship and dissatisfaction with the monarchy's financial policies contributed to widespread unrest.\n   - Certain regions and social classes felt their interests were better represented by Parliament than by the king.\n\n4. **Trigger Events:**\n   - In 1641, Parliament issued the **Grand Remonstrance**, a list of grievances against Charles I, which further inflamed tensions.\n   - The situation escalated in January 1642, when Charles attempted to arrest five members of Parliament, leading many to believe the king could not be trusted.\n   - By August 1642, open warfare broke out after Charles raised his royal standard in Nottingham, signaling the call to arms.\n\n---\n\n### The Course of the Civil War:\nThe English Civil War is traditionally divided into three main phases:\n1. **First English Civil War (1642\u20131646):**\n   - Initial battles, such as the Battle of Edgehill (1642), were inconclusive.\n   - Parliament gradually gained the upper hand, thanks in part to the creation of the **New Model Army**, a well-organized and disciplined force led by figures like **Oliver Cromwell**.\n   - Charles I surrendered to the Scots in 1646, effectively ending the first phase of the war.\n\n2. **Second English Civil War (1648\u20131649):**\n   - Charles I, having been handed over to Parliament by the Scots, attempted to negotiate with different factions to regain power.\n   - This led to renewed fighting in 1648, but the Parliamentarians decisively defeated the Royalists again.\n   - In 1649, Charles I was tried for treason, found guilty, and executed, marking a dramatic turning point in English history.\n\n3. **Third English Civil War (1649\u20131651):**\n   - After Charles I's execution, his son, **Charles II**, attempted to reclaim the throne with support from Scottish Royalists.\n   - The Parliamentarian forces, led by Oliver Cromwell, defeated the Royalists again, most notably at the **Battle of Worcester** in 1651. Charles II fled into exile.\n\n---\n\n### Outcome and Consequences:\n1. **Abolition of the Monarchy:**\n   - After Charles I's execution, the monarchy was abolished, and England became a **republic**, known as the **Commonwealth of England** (1649\u20131660).\n\n2. **Rise of Oliver Cromwell:**\n   - Cromwell emerged as the dominant figure, eventually ruling as **Lord Protector** in a military dictatorship during the **Protectorate** (1653\u20131658).\n\n3. **Restoration of the Monarchy:**\n   - After Cromwell\u2019s death in 1658, the republican experiment faltered. In 1660, Charles II was invited back to England in an event known as the **Restoration**, restoring the monarchy.\n\n4. **Long-Term Impact:**\n   - The war fundamentally changed the balance of power in England. While the monarchy was restored, it was clear that Parliament would play a much greater role in governance moving forward.\n   - These events laid the groundwork for England\u2019s evolution into a constitutional monarchy.\n\nThe English Civil War was not only a political and military struggle but also a transformative period in English history that reshaped the nation's political landscape, religious life, and societal structure.","em":0,"f1":0.2857142857}

It is part of a famous monologue delivered by the melancholy character Jaques in Act II, Scene VII. This speech reflects on the stages of human life and compares the world to a stage where each person plays a series of roles throughout their lifetime. The concept is presented in a poetic and philosophical manner, encapsulating the cyclical nature of life.\n\n### Context in the Play\nIn *As You Like It*, Jaques delivers this speech while musing on the human condition. The monologue begins with the line:\n\n*\"All the world's a stage,  \nAnd all the men and women merely players;  \nThey have their exits and their entrances,  \nAnd one man in his time plays many parts,  \nHis acts being seven ages.\"*\n\nJaques then goes on to describe these seven \"ages\" or roles that a person assumes during life, which are:\n\n1. **The Infant**: A helpless baby who cries and depends entirely on others.\n2. **The Schoolboy**: A reluctant child going to school, described as \"whining\" with a satchel and a \"shining morning face.\"\n3. **The Lover**: A young adult overwhelmed by passion, sighing and writing poems to express love.\n4. **The Soldier**: A bold and ambitious phase, characterized by seeking honor and reputation, even at great personal risk.\n5. **The Justice**: A mature adult full of wisdom and social responsibility, often described as being well-fed and respected.\n6. **The Pantaloon (Old Age)**: A declining phase where the individual becomes frail, physically diminished, and sometimes foolish.\n7. **Second Childishness and Oblivion**: The final stage of life, which Shakespeare poignantly describes as \"sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything,\" symbolizing a return to dependence and a loss of faculties.\n\n### Significance and Interpretation\nThe \"Seven Ages of Man\" speech is considered one of Shakespeare's most famous reflections on life and mortality. It portrays life as a performance, with each individual playing different roles based on their age and circumstances. The cyclical pattern from infancy to old age and eventual death emphasizes the transient and fleeting nature of human existence.\n\nThis speech is often quoted and studied for its timeless wisdom, poetic beauty, and the universality of its themes. It captures the essence of human life in a way that resonates across cultures and centuries.\n\nFor more detailed information on the play *As You Like It* and Shakespeare's works, you can visit the full article on [William Shakespeare](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/William_Shakespeare) or [As You Like It](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/As_You_Like_It) on Wikipedia.","em":0,"f1":0.5833333333}

Originally released on his 1966 live album , Phil Ochs in Concert , `` Love Me , I 'm a Liberal '' was soon one of Ochs 's most popular concert staples . The song mocks the differences between what liberals say and what they do .

Without identifying the specific song or artist, the question cannot be answered accurately.","model_short_answer":["The song critiques self-identified liberals who claim progressive values but fail to take meaningful action or hold hypocritical views."],"model_long_answer":"\"Love Me, I'm a Liberal\" is a satirical protest song written by Phil Ochs, an American folk singer and songwriter known for his politically charged music during the 1960s and 1970s. The song, first released in 1966 on the album *Phil Ochs in Concert*, critiques what Ochs saw as the hypocrisy and complacency of self-identified liberals in the United States during that era.\n\n### Meaning and Context:\nThe song's lyrics take the perspective of a liberal who outwardly supports progressive causes but fails to take meaningful action or exhibits contradictions in their beliefs. It was written during the height of the Civil Rights Movement, the Vietnam War, and other major social upheavals, and Ochs used the song to challenge what he perceived as the performative and superficial nature of many liberals' support for social justice.\n\nThe narrator of the song expresses approval for progressive ideas in theory, but their actions and attitudes reveal a lack of true commitment to change. For example, they support civil rights but disapprove of more radical activists, or they oppose war but don't take concrete steps to resist it. Ochs critiques this \"armchair liberalism,\" where people espouse progressive values without putting their comfort or privilege on the line.\n\n### Key Themes:\n1. **Hypocrisy of Liberalism**: Ochs highlights how some liberals may support change only when it does not inconvenience them. For instance, the narrator claims to have supported Martin Luther King Jr. but disapproves of more confrontational Black leaders, such as Malcolm X or the Black Panthers.\n\n2. **Selective Outrage**: The song mocks the tendency of some liberals to express moral outrage only when it's socially acceptable or easy to do so. It suggests that their activism is more about feeling good about themselves than about effecting real change.\n\n3. **Performative Support**: The title phrase, \"Love me, I'm a liberal,\" is ironic because it critiques the self-congratulatory attitude of some liberals who expect admiration simply for holding progressive views, even if those views are not accompanied by meaningful action.\n\n4. **Satirical Tone**: The song is deeply sarcastic, with Ochs using humor and irony to drive home his points. The light-hearted delivery contrasts with the serious critique embedded in the lyrics.\n\n### Historical Context:\nIn the 1960s, the United States was in a period of intense political and social upheaval. The Civil Rights Movement was challenging systemic racism, the Vietnam War was becoming increasingly unpopular, and young activists were calling for radical change. Ochs, a prominent figure in the protest music scene, often aligned himself with these more radical movements. He viewed mainstream liberals as insufficiently committed to the causes they claimed to support.\n\n### Influence and Legacy:\n\"Love Me, I'm a Liberal\" became an iconic protest song, resonating with audiences who shared Ochs' frustration with the limitations of mainstream liberalism. Over the years, the song has been reinterpreted and rewritten by other artists to reflect contemporary political issues, demonstrating its enduring relevance. For example:\n- Jello Biafra (of the Dead Kennedys) released a punk version in the 1990s that updated the lyrics to critique the liberals of that era.\n- The band *NOFX* performed a version in the 2000s, satirizing liberals in the context of the Iraq War and the George W. Bush presidency.\n\n### Modern Relevance:\nThe themes of the song continue to resonate today, as conversations about performative activism, privilege, and the limitations of centrism persist in political discourse. It remains a powerful critique of the gap between rhetoric and action in progressive politics.\n\nIn summary, \"Love Me, I'm a Liberal\" is a biting and humorous critique of liberal hypocrisy, challenging listeners to reflect on whether their beliefs are matched by their actions. Through its satirical tone, Phil Ochs calls for deeper, more genuine commitment to social and political change.","em":0,"f1":0.0714285714}

Burning Questions of Our Movement\" is a political pamphlet written by Vladimir Lenin in 1901 and published in 1902. It is considered one of Lenin's most significant theoretical works and played a fundamental role in shaping the strategy and tactics of the revolutionary movement that led to the foundation of the Bolshevik Party and, ultimately, the Russian Revolution of 1917.\n\nThe pamphlet was written during a period of intense debate within the Russian socialist movement over how best to organize and achieve revolutionary goals under the repressive conditions of Tsarist rule. Lenin's work addresses what he viewed as critical issues facing the movement, such as the role of the revolutionary party, the nature of political struggle, and the relationship between the working class and intellectual leadership.\n\n### Context and Background\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Russia was a deeply autocratic society, with harsh repression of political dissent and severe economic inequality. The socialist movement in Russia was divided into various factions, including the Social Democrats, who were influenced by Marxist theory, and the Socialist Revolutionaries, who were more focused on agrarian issues. Within the Social Democratic movement, there was further division between those who advocated for a loose, decentralized structure and those who sought a more disciplined, centralized organization.\n\nLenin wrote \"What Is to Be Done?\" in response to these debates, particularly to counter the ideas of \"Economism,\" a trend within Russian Marxism that emphasized economic struggles (such as strikes for better wages and working conditions) over political struggles against the Tsarist autocracy. Lenin argued that this approach was insufficient and that a more organized and theoretically grounded effort was needed to achieve revolution.\n\n### Key Ideas in the Pamphlet\n1. **The Role of the Vanguard Party:**\n   Lenin argued for the creation of a tightly organized, professional revolutionary party composed of dedicated and disciplined revolutionaries. He believed that the working class, left to its own devices, would only achieve \"trade union consciousness\" \u2014 the pursuit of economic gains within the existing system \u2014 and that it needed guidance from a vanguard of intellectuals and professional revolutionaries to achieve political consciousness and overthrow the Tsarist regime.\n\n2. **Rejection of \"Economism\":**\n   Lenin criticized the \"Economists,\" who prioritized economic issues over political ones. He believed that focusing solely on economic struggles would limit the revolutionary potential of the working class. Instead, he argued that the movement must address broader political issues and aim for the overthrow of the entire autocratic system.\n\n3. **Importance of Political Propaganda and Agitation:**\n   Lenin emphasized the need for political education and agitation to raise awareness among the working class about the broader systemic injustices of Tsarism and capitalism. He argued that revolutionaries must provide leadership by exposing and challenging the political and social structures of oppression.\n\n4. **Centralization and Organization:**\n   Lenin advocated for a centralized party structure to ensure unity and effectiveness in the revolutionary struggle. He believed that a disorganized movement would be easily suppressed by the Tsarist authorities and that only a disciplined, hierarchical organization could succeed under such conditions of repression.\n\n5. **Revolutionary Theory as a Guide:**\n   Lenin famously stated, \"Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement.\" He argued that Marxist theory was essential for understanding social and political conditions and for developing a practical strategy to achieve revolution.\n\n### Legacy and Impact\n\"What Is to Be Done?\" had a profound impact on the Russian socialist movement and the development of Leninism as a distinct strand of Marxist thought. The ideas outlined in the pamphlet laid the foundation for the split between the Bolsheviks (led by Lenin) and the Mensheviks within the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP) in 1903. The Bolsheviks embraced Lenin's vision of a centralized, disciplined party, while the Mensheviks favored a more democratic and inclusive approach.\n\nThe organizational principles outlined in \"What Is to Be Done?\" became a cornerstone of Bolshevik strategy and were instrumental in their eventual success in seizing power during the October Revolution of 1917. However, Lenin's emphasis on centralization and the role of the vanguard party has been a subject of significant debate and criticism, with some arguing that it contributed to the authoritarian tendencies of the Soviet state.\n\nIn summary, \"What Is to Be Done?\" is a critical work in the history of socialist thought and revolutionary practice. It provides insight into Lenin's vision of political organization and strategy and has had a lasting influence on Marxist theory and revolutionary movements worldwide.","em":0,"f1":0.4375}

Several factors contributed to the NCAA Tournament's rise in prominence over the NIT, including changes in participation rules, media coverage, and the NCAA's growing control over college basketball. Below is a detailed explanation of this shift:\n\n### Early Years: NIT as the Premier Tournament\nWhen the NIT was founded in 1938, it was considered the premier college basketball postseason tournament. The NCAA Tournament debuted a year later in 1939 but initially had less prestige. The NIT, run by the Metropolitan Basketball Writers Association and played entirely at Madison Square Garden in New York City, attracted top teams and provided greater media exposure due to its central location in New York, the media capital of the United States. Many teams preferred the NIT because it had higher visibility and a glamorous reputation.\n\n### NCAA's Rise in the 1950s and 1960s\n1. **Rule Changes by the NCAA**:\n   - In the early years, teams could participate in both tournaments, and in some cases, teams that won the NIT also played in the NCAA Tournament. For example, in 1940, Colorado won the NIT and advanced to the NCAA Tournament.\n   - However, starting in the 1950s, the NCAA began prohibiting teams selected for its tournament from participating in the NIT. This forced teams to choose, and many opted for the NCAA Tournament as it gained prestige.\n\n2. **Expansion of the NCAA Tournament**:\n   - The NCAA Tournament expanded its field and geographic reach, making it more inclusive and competitive. From its original 8 teams in 1939, the NCAA Tournament grew to 16 teams by 1951 and continued to grow in size over the decades, ultimately becoming a national spectacle.\n\n3. **Television Coverage**:\n   - The rise of television played a significant role in the NCAA Tournament surpassing the NIT. The NCAA Tournament began receiving national television coverage in the 1960s, which gave it far greater exposure than the NIT. The NCAA capitalized on this by marketing the tournament as the definitive championship, further increasing its appeal.\n\n4. **Integration of College Basketball**:\n   - The NCAA Tournament's willingness to include and highlight teams from across the country, including historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and teams with racially integrated rosters, also helped it gain credibility as the true national championship. In contrast, the NIT was slower to embrace these changes.\n\n5. **Prestige of the NCAA Championship**:\n   - The NCAA Tournament began to produce legendary champions and stars, such as Bill Russell's University of San Francisco teams in the 1950s and John Wooden's UCLA dynasty in the 1960s and 1970s. These iconic moments and players helped solidify the NCAA Tournament as the ultimate goal for college basketball teams.\n\n### Legal and Structural Changes: 1970s and Beyond\nThe NIT's importance continued to decline after the NCAA Tournament became dominant in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1971, the NCAA further cemented its control by passing a rule that required conference champions to participate in the NCAA Tournament, preventing them from choosing the NIT. The NIT was relegated to hosting teams that did not make the NCAA Tournament, making it a \"consolation\" tournament.\n\n### Lawsuit and NCAA Control\nIn 2005, the NCAA acquired the NIT after a legal battle. The Metropolitan Intercollegiate Basketball Association (MIBA), which previously ran the NIT, accused the NCAA of using its power to monopolize postseason basketball and force teams into the NCAA Tournament. The NCAA settled the lawsuit for $56.5 million and took over the NIT, further solidifying the NCAA Tournament's dominance.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile the NIT was initially the more prestigious tournament in the early years of college basketball, the NCAA Tournament surpassed it by the 1950s and 1960s, primarily due to the NCAA's rules, the tournament's expansion, and the rise of television. Today, the NCAA Tournament, often referred to as \"March Madness,\" is regarded as the premier event in college basketball, while the NIT serves as a secondary tournament for teams that do not make the NCAA field.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

Without specifying which season or edition is intended, the referent remains ambiguous.","model_short_answer":["Mandy Moore","Daniella Karagach","Jenna Johnson","Other professional dancers and choreographers on the show"],"model_long_answer":"On \"Dancing with the Stars,\" the choreography is primarily created by the professional dancers who are paired with the celebrity contestants. Each professional dancer is responsible for choreographing routines tailored to their partner's skill level, personality, and the specific dance style assigned for that week. These pros are highly skilled ballroom and Latin dancers with extensive experience in both competitive dancing and choreography.\n\n### Key Points on Choreography in the Show:\n1. **Professional Dancers as Choreographers**: Each pro designs the routines for their celebrity partner. The choreography must not only showcase the celebrity's abilities but also adhere to the specific rules and techniques of the assigned dance style (e.g., salsa, tango, waltz, or freestyle).\n\n2. **Freestyle Week**: During the finale, the pros often have the most creative freedom in their choreography, as the \"freestyle\" allows them to incorporate elements outside traditional ballroom or Latin dance styles, such as contemporary, hip-hop, or even acrobatics.\n\n3. **Collaborations**: In some cases, choreographers and dance specialists from outside the main cast are brought in to assist. For example, guest choreographers might help with specialized routines, group dances, or themed performances (e.g., Disney, Broadway, or Movie Night).\n\n4. **Themed Performances**: Many episodes have specific themes (e.g., Halloween, Disney, or \"Most Memorable Year\"), which heavily influence the choreography. The pros must incorporate the theme while staying true to the dance style.\n\n5. **Judging**: The choreography is one of the aspects that judges (such as Carrie Ann Inaba, Derek Hough, and Bruno Tonioli, as of recent seasons) critique. Routines are evaluated on technique, creativity, difficulty, and entertainment value.\n\n### Notable Choreographers:\nWhile the professional dancers are the primary choreographers, some seasons have featured guest choreographers for special routines or group performances. For example:\n- Mandy Moore (not the singer\/actress, but the Emmy-winning choreographer) has contributed to group numbers and special performances.\n- Other professional choreographers with expertise in various styles might assist during themed weeks.\n\n### Professional Dancers as Choreographers:\nThe professional dancers on the show vary by season, but some of the fan-favorite pros over the years have included:\n- Derek Hough\n- Maksim Chmerkovskiy\n- Val Chmerkovskiy\n- Cheryl Burke\n- Witney Carson\n- Emma Slater\n- Jenna Johnson\n- Mark Ballas\n- Lindsay Arnold\n- Artem Chigvintsev\n\nThese dancers are responsible for making the routines dynamic, engaging, and technically sound while teaching their celebrity partners how to execute the moves. The process is challenging, as many of the celebrities come into the competition with little to no dance experience.\n\n### Behind-the-Scenes Work:\nChoreography on \"Dancing with the Stars\" is a collaborative effort involving not only the professional dancers but also the show's production team. Lighting, costumes, and stage design are carefully coordinated to complement the choreography and enhance the performance for both the live audience and TV viewers.\n\nIn summary, the choreography for \"Dancing with the Stars\" is carried out by the professional dancer partnered with each celebrity, with occasional input from guest choreographers or the production team for special routines. These routines are a key factor in the success and entertainment value of the show.","em":0,"f1":0.6666666667}

Its primary aim is to protect consumers when they borrow money or buy goods and services on credit. The Act ensures that credit agreements are clear, fair, and transparent, while also providing a legal framework for the relationship between consumers and lenders. Below is a detailed breakdown of the Act's aims:\n\n### 1. **Consumer Protection**\n   - The core aim of the Consumer Credit Act is to safeguard consumers from unfair practices and exploitation by lenders or credit providers.\n   - It ensures that borrowers are fully informed about the terms and conditions of a credit agreement before they sign it, including interest rates, repayment schedules, and any associated fees or charges.\n\n### 2. **Regulation of Credit Agreements**\n   - The Act regulates various types of consumer credit agreements, such as credit cards, personal loans, hire-purchase agreements, and store cards.\n   - It establishes rules about what information must be included in credit agreements and how this information should be presented (e.g., in a clear and understandable way).\n\n### 3. **Licensing of Credit Providers**\n   - The Act requires businesses that offer credit or hire agreements to hold a valid credit license (now regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, or FCA, following the transfer of regulatory powers from the Office of Fair Trading in 2014).\n   - This ensures that only reputable companies can operate in the consumer credit market, reducing the risk of fraud or unethical practices.\n\n### 4. **Right to Cancel Agreements**\n   - The Act gives consumers certain rights, such as a **14-day cooling-off period** during which they can cancel a credit agreement without penalty.\n   - This allows consumers to reconsider their decisions and avoid entering into agreements they later regret.\n\n### 5. **Disclosure of Information**\n   - Lenders are legally obligated to provide consumers with detailed information about the credit agreement under the Act. This includes:\n     - The annual percentage rate (APR), which reflects the cost of borrowing.\n     - The total amount payable.\n     - Any penalties or fees for late repayments.\n   - This transparency helps consumers compare different credit options and make informed decisions.\n\n### 6. **Fair Treatment of Borrowers**\n   - The Act prohibits unfair or deceptive practices by lenders, such as misleading advertising or hidden fees.\n   - It also sets out rules for dealing with borrowers in difficulty, ensuring that debt collection practices are fair and not oppressive.\n\n### 7. **Protection Against Unfair Terms**\n   - The Act allows courts to intervene if a credit agreement contains unfair or extortionate terms that exploit the consumer.\n\n### 8. **Consumer Credit Agreements Covered**\n   - The Act applies to a wide range of credit agreements, including:\n     - Personal loans.\n     - Credit cards.\n     - Hire purchase agreements (e.g., buying a car on finance).\n     - Store credit.\n   - It covers agreements between \u00a350 and \u00a325,000 (though this upper limit has been removed under subsequent amendments).\n\n### 9. **Credit Reference Agencies**\n   - The Act governs how credit reference agencies operate and ensures that consumers have the right to access their credit file and challenge incorrect information.\n\n### 10. **Enforcement and Redress**\n   - If a lender breaches the rules set out in the Consumer Credit Act, the agreement may become unenforceable, and consumers may be entitled to compensation.\n   - The Act also provides consumers with access to the Financial Ombudsman Service for independent dispute resolution.\n\n### Amendments and Updates\nThe Consumer Credit Act 1974 has been amended over the years, most notably by the **Consumer Credit Act 2006**, which strengthened consumer protections. Changes introduced by the 2006 Act include:\n   - Removing the \u00a325,000 upper limit for regulated agreements, so larger loans are now covered.\n   - Introducing an \"unfair relationship\" test, which allows courts to examine whether a credit agreement puts the consumer at a significant disadvantage.\n   - Improving access to redress for consumers.\n\n### Summary of the Act\u2019s Aim\nIn essence, the aim of the Consumer Credit Act is to create a fair, transparent, and regulated credit market that protects consumers while ensuring that lenders operate responsibly. It balances the need to facilitate access to credit with the necessity of preventing exploitation and financial harm to borrowers. By setting clear rules and providing safeguards, the Act helps consumers make informed decisions and promotes trust in the credit industry.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the relevant sections of the Act on the [UK legislation website](https:\/\/www.legislation.gov.uk\/) or consult the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s guidance on consumer credit.","em":0,"f1":0.1777777778}

Specifically, the Taj Mahal is one of the most famous examples of **funerary architecture**, designed to commemorate the deceased while also serving as a masterpiece of beauty and artistic achievement.\n\nCommissioned in 1632 by the Mughal Emperor **Shah Jahan**, the Taj Mahal was built in memory of his beloved wife, **Mumtaz Mahal**, who died while giving birth to their 14th child. The structure combines elements of **Islamic, Persian, Ottoman Turkish, and Indian architecture**, and its design reflects a deep sense of reverence, love, and spirituality.\n\n### Aesthetic Value and Function\nThe Taj Mahal exemplifies how aesthetic value can enhance the function of a memorial or mausoleum. While its primary purpose is to serve as an eternal resting place for Mumtaz Mahal (and later Shah Jahan himself), its incredible beauty and architectural harmony elevate it beyond a mere tomb. Here's how its aesthetic value ties into its function:\n\n1. **Symbol of Eternal Love**: The Taj Mahal's breathtaking beauty, with its glistening white marble, intricate carvings, and symmetrical design, symbolizes the eternal love Shah Jahan had for Mumtaz Mahal. Its creation was as much an emotional gesture as it was a functional one.\n\n2. **Spiritual Significance**: The mausoleum\u2019s design incorporates symbolic elements meant to reflect paradise, as described in Islamic theology. For example, its central dome resembles a lotus flower (symbolizing purity and divinity), and the surrounding gardens (known as the Charbagh) represent the Quranic vision of paradise. This spiritual ambiance aligns with its function as a place of eternal rest.\n\n3. **Cultural Legacy**: The Taj Mahal stands as a masterpiece of Mughal art and architecture, designed to inspire awe and admiration. Its aesthetic value makes it a cultural and artistic icon, ensuring that it fulfills its memorial function not just for Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal, but for humanity at large.\n\n4. **Use of Materials and Techniques**: The Taj Mahal\u2019s construction utilized luxurious materials, including white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones such as jade, jasper, turquoise, and lapis lazuli. The calligraphy, floral motifs, and geometric patterns enhance its artistic value, while also drawing the gaze heavenward, aligning with its spiritual and commemorative purpose.\n\n### Broader Influence\nThe Taj Mahal\u2019s design and aesthetic value have inspired numerous other buildings around the world. Its grandeur sets a benchmark for how architecture can serve both functional and artistic purposes, demonstrating how beauty and utility can coexist in a single structure.\n\nIn essence, the Taj Mahal is an unparalleled example of how aesthetic value can elevate a functional structure\u2014in this case, a mausoleum\u2014into something timeless, transcendent, and universally admired.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

This concept is fundamental in geometry, physics, navigation, and many real-world applications such as mapping and GPS systems.\n\n### 1. **Length (or Magnitude):**\nThe length of the straight line is the **distance** between the two locations. In a two-dimensional (2D) space, the distance between two points \\( A(x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( B(x_2, y_2) \\) can be calculated using the **distance formula**, which is derived from the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n\\]\n\nIn three-dimensional (3D) space, if the points are \\( A(x_1, y_1, z_1) \\) and \\( B(x_2, y_2, z_2) \\), the formula becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}\n\\]\n\nThis gives the straight-line (or **Euclidean**) distance between the two points.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Direction:**\nThe direction of the straight line indicates the path or orientation from one point to the other. It is often represented as an **angle** or in terms of a **unit vector**.\n\n- In 2D, the direction can be described using the angle \\(\\theta\\), which the line makes with a reference axis (usually the positive x-axis). The angle can be found using the **inverse tangent function**:\n\n\\[\n\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\right)\n\\]\n\n- In 3D, the direction is described using directional cosines or a unit vector, which normalizes the vector to have a magnitude of 1.\n\nA **unit vector** in the direction of the line can be calculated by dividing the components of the vector by the magnitude (length):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Unit Vector} = \\frac{(x_2 - x_1, y_2 - y_1, z_2 - z_1)}{\\text{Distance}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Applications:**\nThe concept of length and direction is widely used in various fields:\n- **Physics:** To describe force, velocity, or displacement as vectors.\n- **Navigation:** To find the shortest path or course between two locations.\n- **Graphics and Design:** To render objects and calculate their orientations.\n- **Geography and GPS:** To measure distances and bearings between two locations on Earth.\n\nFor points on a sphere (like the Earth), the shortest distance is not a straight line in the Euclidean sense but an arc along the great circle. This is calculated using spherical geometry or the **haversine formula** for distances:\n\n\\[\na = \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\phi}{2}\\right) + \\cos(\\phi_1) \\cos(\\phi_2) \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = 2r \\cdot \\arcsin(\\sqrt{a})\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(\\phi_1\\) and \\(\\phi_2\\) are the latitudes, \\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_2\\) are the longitudes, and \\(r\\) is the Earth's radius.\n\n---\n\nIn summary, the **length** refers to the straight-line distance between two points, while the **direction** refers to the orientation or angle of that line.

Without specifying the market or crash criteria, the answer depends on interpretation and lacks a clear referent.","model_short_answer":["March 2020"],"model_long_answer":"The most recent significant stock market crash occurred in **March 2020**, during the onset of the **COVID-19 pandemic**. This crash was triggered by widespread panic over the global economic impact of the pandemic, as governments imposed lockdowns, businesses shut down, and demand in various sectors plummeted.\n\n### Key Details of the March 2020 Crash:\n1. **Causes**: \n   - The primary driver was the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused investors to fear a severe global recession.\n   - Oil prices also collapsed after Saudi Arabia and Russia entered a price war, further shaking investor confidence.\n   - Supply chain disruptions and travel restrictions exacerbated the situation.\n\n2. **Timeline**:\n   - On February 20, 2020, U.S. markets began to decline as the virus spread outside of China.\n   - Between **February 20 and March 23, 2020**, the S&P 500 fell about **34%**, marking one of the fastest declines into bear market territory in history.\n   - The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) had its worst single-day point drop on **March 16, 2020**, falling nearly **3,000 points**.\n\n3. **Global Impact**:\n   - Stock markets worldwide plummeted.\n   - The U.S. stock market experienced multiple trading halts, known as \"circuit breakers,\" due to extreme volatility.\n   - Investor panic led to a massive sell-off, with many seeking safer assets like gold and U.S. Treasury bonds.\n\n4. **Recovery**:\n   - The U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks intervened with aggressive monetary policy measures, including slashing interest rates and implementing quantitative easing.\n   - Governments around the world rolled out stimulus packages to support businesses and individuals.\n   - The markets began to recover in late March 2020 and rebounded significantly throughout the year, fueled by optimism over government support and vaccine development.\n\n### Comparison to Other Crashes:\nWhile the March 2020 crash was severe, it was relatively short-lived compared to other major crashes like the **Great Depression (1929)** or the **2008 Global Financial Crisis**, which involved deeper systemic issues in the economy. The 2020 crash was more of a reaction to a sudden external event (the pandemic) rather than underlying financial instability.\n\n### Other Recent Declines:\n- In **2022**, global stock markets experienced a significant downturn due to rising inflation, Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, and geopolitical tensions (e.g., the Russia-Ukraine war). However, this was not classified as a \"crash\" but rather a bear market and prolonged correction.\n\nFor more detailed information on stock market crashes, you can also explore the [Wikipedia article on stock market crashes](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stock_market_crash).","em":0,"f1":0.0}

This experiment, known as the **Hershey-Chase experiment**, provided critical evidence that DNA is the molecule responsible for heredity.\n\n### Background and Context:\nAt the time, scientists were debating whether DNA or proteins carried genetic information. Proteins seemed more likely to many researchers because they are more structurally complex, compared to DNA, which appeared to have a simpler structure. Hershey and Chase aimed to resolve this question by studying bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria. Bacteriophages are simple entities made up of only two components: **a protein coat** and **DNA** inside.\n\n### Key Experimental Design:\nTo distinguish between DNA and protein as the genetic material, Hershey and Chase used two sets of bacteriophages, each labeled with a different radioactive isotope:\n\n1. **Radioactive sulfur-35 (35S)** was used to label the proteins because sulfur is found in proteins (in amino acids like cysteine and methionine) but not in DNA.\n2. **Radioactive phosphorus-32 (32P)** was used to label the DNA because phosphorus is found in DNA (in the phosphate backbone) but not in proteins.\n\nThey then allowed these labeled bacteriophages to infect bacteria (specifically *E. coli*). After infection, they used a blender and centrifuge to separate the phage protein coats from the bacterial cells and checked where the radioactivity ended up.\n\n### Key Findings:\n1. **In the experiment with 35S-labeled protein**, the radioactive sulfur was found in the liquid (in the phage coats), but not inside the bacteria. This indicated that the proteins did not enter the bacterial cells during infection.\n2. **In the experiment with 32P-labeled DNA**, the radioactive phosphorus was found inside the bacteria. This showed that DNA was injected into the bacterial cells by the phages.\n\nSince only the material that entered the bacteria could direct the production of new viruses, Hershey and Chase concluded that **DNA, not protein, is the genetic material**.\n\n### Significance:\nThis experiment was a groundbreaking moment in molecular biology because it provided strong evidence that DNA is the molecule of inheritance. It helped shift scientific focus toward understanding DNA's structure and function, paving the way for the discovery of the DNA double helix by Watson and Crick in 1953. Hershey and Chase's work was pivotal in confirming that DNA is the universal carrier of genetic information.","em":0,"f1":0.1052631579}

This type of eclipse occurs when the Moon is too far from Earth to completely cover the Sun, leaving a \"ring of fire\" around the edges.\n\n- **For timing**: The eclipse will begin in the U.S. in Oregon around **9:13 a.m. PDT**, reach its maximum at around **10:20 a.m. PDT**, and end in Texas around **12:03 p.m. CDT**.\n- The total duration of the eclipse will vary depending on your location, but the \"ring of fire\" (maximum annularity) will last about 4-5 minutes in the best viewing areas.\n\n### Total Solar Eclipse in 2024\nThe next **total solar eclipse** visible in the U.S. will occur on **April 8, 2024**. During a total solar eclipse, the Moon completely covers the Sun, turning day into night for a short period.\n\n- This eclipse will pass through parts of Mexico, the U.S., and Canada. In the U.S., the path of totality will cross states such as Texas, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, New York, Vermont, and Maine.\n- The eclipse will begin in the U.S. around **12:30 p.m. CDT**, with totality occurring in different locations between **1:30 p.m. CDT and 3:00 p.m. CDT**, depending on your location. The eclipse will end in the U.S. around **3:00-4:00 p.m. EDT**.\n\n### Lunar Eclipses in 2023\nThe next **lunar eclipse** visible in the U.S. is a **partial lunar eclipse** on **October 28\u201329, 2023**. Unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are visible from anywhere on the night side of Earth, weather permitting.\n\n- The partial eclipse will begin at **2:35 p.m. EDT** on October 28, reach its maximum at **4:14 p.m. EDT**, and end at **5:52 p.m. EDT**.

","category":"Undetermined standard or preference","judgment":"underspecified","reasoning":"The request is underspecified because the phrase \"economic sector\" is broad and can refer to multiple categories (e.g., financial, industrial, service, etc.), and the question does not clarify which specific sector is being asked about. Public companies can belong to various sectors, and the question lacks a specific referent or context to narrow the answer.","model_short_answer":["Public companies are part of the private sector."],"model_long_answer":"Public companies are part of the **private sector** of the economy. To provide context, the economy is generally divided into three main sectors: the **public sector**, the **private sector**, and the **voluntary or third sector**. Here's how public companies fit into the economic structure:\n\n### Understanding Public Companies\nA **public company** (or publicly traded company) is a business entity whose shares are traded on a stock exchange or in over-the-counter markets. These companies raise capital by selling shares of ownership to the public, allowing anyone to invest in them. Examples of public companies include giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon, whose shares trade on stock exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or Nasdaq.\n\n### Economic Sector Classification\n1. **Public Sector**: This sector includes government-owned entities, organizations, and services funded by taxes, such as schools, police departments, and infrastructure projects. Public companies, despite the similarity in name, are **not part of this sector** because they are not owned or operated by the government.\n\n2. **Private Sector**: The private sector encompasses businesses and organizations that are not owned by the government but are owned by private individuals, shareholders, or companies. Public companies fall into this sector because, while their shares are publicly traded, they are still owned by private individuals and institutional investors. They operate for profit, and their activities are driven by market forces.\n\n3. **Voluntary\/Third Sector**: This sector includes non-profit organizations, charities, and social enterprises that focus on social causes rather than generating profit. Public companies are not part of this sector.\n\n### Key Characteristics of Public Companies in the Private Sector\n- **Ownership**: Public companies are owned by shareholders, who may include individuals, institutional investors (like mutual funds), or other entities.\n- **Profit Motive**: Like other private-sector entities, public companies aim to generate profit for their shareholders.\n- **Regulation**: Public companies are subject to strict regulatory requirements, including financial disclosures, to protect investors and maintain transparency.\n- **Market Orientation**: Their operations are heavily influenced by market demand, competition, and shareholder expectations.\n\n### Examples of Economic Sectors\n- Public Sector: U.S. Postal Service, public schools, national defense\n- Private Sector: Tesla Inc., Coca-Cola, small businesses\n- Voluntary Sector: Red Cross, Oxfam, Habitat for Humanity\n\nIn summary, public companies are part of the **private sector**, and they play a significant role in driving economic growth, innovation, and employment within this sector.","em":0,"f1":0.4444444444}

The play eventually appeared in print in the **First Folio of 1623**, the first collected edition of Shakespeare's works.\n\nSome historians also suggest that *As You Like It* may have been performed for a private audience before its public debut, possibly at the court of Queen Elizabeth I or a noble household. However, there is no surviving evidence to confirm this.\n\n*As You Like It* is one of Shakespeare's most beloved comedies, known for its themes of love, identity, and the pastoral life, as well as its famous characters like Rosalind, Jaques, and Touchstone. The play's enduring appeal lies in its exploration of human relationships, witty dialogue, and the joyful resolution of conflicts in the idyllic Forest of Arden.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

The referent is ambiguous, and the question lacks a necessary component to resolve the ambiguity.","model_short_answer":["Greek"],"model_long_answer":"The Olympic Anthem is traditionally performed in **Greek** during the official opening and closing ceremonies of the Olympic Games. This is because the anthem was originally written in Greek, reflecting the origins of the Olympics in ancient Greece.\n\n### Background on the Olympic Anthem:\nThe Olympic Anthem, also known as the \"Olympic Hymn,\" was composed by **Spyridon Samaras** with lyrics by **Kostis Palamas**, a Greek poet. It was first performed at the **opening ceremony of the inaugural modern Olympic Games in Athens in 1896**. The Greek language is integral to the anthem, as it pays homage to the ancient roots of the Olympic Games.\n\n### Modern Traditions:\nWhile the anthem is typically sung in Greek, in some cases, it has been translated and performed in other languages, depending on the host country's preferences. However, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) officially adopted the original Greek version of the anthem in **1958**, and it is now considered the standard version.\n\n### Lyrics:\nThe lyrics of the Olympic Anthem celebrate the ideals of the Games, such as unity, peace, and human excellence. For example, the first lines in Greek are:\n\n> \"\u1f08\u03c1\u03c7\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b1 \u1f00\u03b8\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd,  \n> \u1f00\u03b3\u03bd\u1f78 \u03c0\u03b1\u1fd6\u03b4\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u1f78\u03c2 \u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2,  \n> \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03b2\u03b7\u03b8\u03b9, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bb\u03ac\u03bc\u03c8\u03bf\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd\u03b8\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5  \n> \u1f09\u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b4\u03cc\u03be\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c6\u03ad\u03b3\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2.\"\n\nIn English translation, these lines mean:\n\n> \"Immortal spirit of antiquity,  \n> Father of the true, beautiful, and good,  \n> Descend, appear, shed over us  \n> Thy light upon this ground and under this sky.\"\n\n### Performance in Host Countries:\nAt the Olympic ceremonies, the anthem is often accompanied by orchestral music, and the language of performance generally remains Greek, regardless of the host country's language. This consistency ensures a universal connection to the Olympic spirit and its historical roots.\n\nHowever, some host nations may include translations or adaptations in their local languages for cultural presentations during other parts of the ceremonies.","em":1,"f1":1.0}

It could refer to a baseball term, a metaphorical expression, a song title, or a cultural reference, but without additional context or clarification, the intended meaning remains unclear. The question lacks specificity in terms of definition, context, or standard.","model_short_answer":["A metaphor for achieving success or a significant milestone in a romantic or dating context."],"model_long_answer":"The phrase \"home run with a girl\" is a slang expression that originates from baseball terminology but is used metaphorically to describe romantic or sexual success in a relationship. In this context, the term \"home run\" refers to achieving a significant milestone in physical intimacy or romantic interaction.\n\n### Context of the Term:\nIn baseball, a \"home run\" is when a batter hits the ball out of the field and is able to round all the bases and score a run. Over time, this term has been adopted into popular culture as part of a metaphorical \"base system\" to describe levels of physical intimacy in a romantic or sexual relationship. The \"bases\" in this metaphor vary depending on cultural and individual interpretations, but they generally follow this progression:\n\n1. **First Base**: Kissing.\n2. **Second Base**: Touching above the waist (e.g., making out, touching over or under clothing).\n3. **Third Base**: Touching below the waist or more intimate activities.\n4. **Home Run**: Sexual intercourse.\n\n### How the Term is Used\nWhen someone says they \"hit a home run\" with a girl (or anyone), they are implying that they reached the final stage of physical intimacy according to this metaphorical system. It is important to note that this term can be seen as objectifying or reductive if used disrespectfully or without considering the feelings of the people involved.\n\n### Broader Considerations\n- **Consent and Respect**: Any physical intimacy in a relationship should be consensual and respectful. It's important to communicate openly with your partner about boundaries and feelings.\n- **Cultural Differences**: The \"base system\" metaphor is most commonly associated with Western cultures and may not be familiar or relevant in other parts of the world.\n- **Maturity and Sensitivity**: Using terms like \"home run\" in conversations about relationships can sometimes trivialize meaningful emotional connections or reduce them to a \"scorekeeping\" mentality. Being mindful of how these expressions come across is key.\n\nIn short, \"home run with a girl\" is a slang expression referring to achieving full physical intimacy, but it is always important to approach relationships with respect, mutual understanding, and clear communication.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

This event is considered one of the most significant tragedies in music history.\n\nInterestingly, two famous musicians narrowly avoided being on that ill-fated flight due to a combination of chance and circumstance. Here\u2019s the story of who missed the plane and why:\n\n### 1. **Waylon Jennings**  \nWaylon Jennings, who later became a major country music star, was part of Buddy Holly's band at the time. Initially, Jennings was supposed to fly on the small chartered plane. However, due to the freezing cold weather and the group's fatigue from traveling in an unheated bus, The Big Bopper asked Jennings if he could take his seat on the plane because he was feeling ill. Jennings agreed to give up his seat.\n\nIn a chilling anecdote, Buddy Holly jokingly said to Jennings before the flight, \"Well, I hope your old bus freezes up!\" To which Jennings jokingly replied, \"Well, I hope your old plane crashes!\" Jennings later admitted that those words haunted him for years.\n\n### 2. **Tommy Allsup**  \nTommy Allsup, the guitarist for Buddy Holly, also narrowly missed the plane. Ritchie Valens, who was reportedly nervous about flying but wanted to avoid another cold bus ride, asked Allsup for his seat. To decide who would take the seat, they flipped a coin at the Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake, where the group had performed earlier that evening. Valens won the coin toss and took Allsup's place on the flight. Allsup later remarked that it was the \"unluckiest coin toss\" he ever lost.\n\n### 3. **Dion DiMucci** (of Dion and the Belmonts)  \nDion was also part of the Winter Dance Party tour and was invited to fly on the plane. However, he declined because he couldn\u2019t justify spending the $36 fee for the flight (equivalent to around $350 today). To him, the expense felt extravagant, as it was the same amount his parents paid monthly for rent when he was growing up in the Bronx. He ultimately opted to stay on the bus.\n\n### Legacy and Impact  \nThe crash devastated the music world and became immortalized as \"The Day the Music Died\" in Don McLean's 1971 song \"American Pie.\" The deaths of Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens (just 17 years old), and The Big Bopper (aged 28) marked a significant loss for early rock and roll, as all three were rising stars with promising careers.\n\nWaylon Jennings, Tommy Allsup, and Dion all went on to have long and successful music careers, but they carried the weight of the tragedy with them for the rest of their lives. For Jennings and Allsup in particular, their close brushes with death on that day became defining moments in their personal histories.","em":1,"f1":1.0}

Without clarifying the specific religious or cultural framework, the referent remains open to multiple interpretations, making the question underspecified.","model_short_answer":["Those who have accepted salvation through faith in Jesus Christ."],"model_long_answer":"The concept of the \"Book of Life\" appears primarily in religious texts, particularly within the Bible, and has deep theological significance in Christianity and Judaism. It is often described as a divine record maintained by God, listing the names of those who are righteous or who will inherit eternal life. Below, I\u2019ll explain how the \"Book of Life\" is understood in different religious contexts:\n\n---\n\n### **In Judaism**\nIn Jewish tradition, the \"Book of Life\" is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) and later in rabbinic literature. It is often associated with the High Holy Days of **Rosh Hashanah** and **Yom Kippur**, which are times of reflection, repentance, and judgment. During this period, Jews believe that God judges all living beings and inscribes the names of the righteous in the Book of Life for the upcoming year, while the wicked may be inscribed in the \"Book of Death.\"\n\n- **Biblical References**:\n  - **Exodus 32:32-33**: After the Israelites sin by worshiping the golden calf, Moses pleads with God: \"But now, if you will forgive their sin, very well; but if not, please erase me from the book that you have written.\" God replies, \"Whoever has sinned against me, I will erase from my book.\"\n  - **Psalm 69:28**: The psalmist refers to the wicked, saying, \"May they be blotted out of the book of life, and not be listed with the righteous.\"\n\nThis idea underscores the belief that God keeps a record of human deeds and judges people accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### **In Christianity**\nThe \"Book of Life\" is a prominent theme in the New Testament, where it is closely tied to salvation, eternal life, and judgment. It is described as the record of those who will inherit eternal life in Heaven. According to Christian theology, the names in the Book of Life are those who have been saved through their faith in Jesus Christ.\n\n- **Biblical References**:\n  - **Philippians 4:3**: Paul refers to his fellow workers in the Gospel, saying, \"whose names are in the book of life.\"\n  - **Revelation 3:5**: Jesus tells the church in Sardis, \"The one who is victorious will, like them, be dressed in white. I will never blot out the name of that person from the book of life but will acknowledge that name before my Father and his angels.\"\n  - **Revelation 20:12, 15**: In the vision of the final judgment, John writes, \"And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life... Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.\"\n  - **Revelation 21:27**: Regarding the New Jerusalem, it says, \"Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life.\"\n\nIn Christian belief, the \"Lamb's Book of Life\" specifically refers to those who have been redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ, the \"Lamb of God.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Who Is Written in the Book of Life?**\n1. **In Judaism**, the Book of Life includes the righteous, those who follow God\u2019s commandments, repent for their sins, and seek to live moral, upright lives. The listing may be temporary, as it is reassessed annually during the High Holy Days.\n2. **In Christianity**, the Book of Life is a permanent record of those who are saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ (Ephesians 2:8-9). Christians believe that salvation is not earned by works but is a gift of God to those who accept Jesus as their Savior.\n\n---\n\n### **Theological Interpretations**\n- **Predestination vs. Free Will**: Some Christian denominations debate whether names are written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world (predestination) or if individuals have the free will to choose salvation and be added to the Book of Life later.\n- **Blotting Out Names**: Revelation 3:5 suggests that names can be \"blotted out\" of the Book of Life, which raises theological questions about the permanence of salvation. Different Christian traditions interpret this verse differently, with some emphasizing eternal security and others highlighting the possibility of falling away from faith.\n\n---\n\n### **Symbolism of the Book of Life**\nThe \"Book of Life\" serves as a symbolic representation of God\u2019s omniscience and justice. It reassures believers that their faithfulness, repentance, and good deeds are remembered and that they will ultimately be rewarded with eternal life. It also underscores the importance of moral accountability and the hope of divine mercy.\n\nIn summary, the \"Book of Life\" is a spiritual metaphor that represents the ultimate hope for eternal life for the faithful and righteous, whether in Judaism or Christianity.","em":0,"f1":0.0952380952}

It was commissioned by Sir **Henry Cole**, a prominent British civil servant, educator, and innovator who played a key role in the development of the modern postal system in the United Kingdom.\n\n### Background on the First Christmas Card:\nSir Henry Cole was instrumental in introducing the **Penny Post** in the UK, which made sending letters and cards more affordable to the general public. To encourage people to use this new postal system, Cole came up with the idea of creating a card specifically for Christmas greetings.\n\nHe approached his friend, the artist **John Callcott Horsley**, to design the card. Horsley produced a triptych design, with the central panel showing a family gathered around a table enjoying a festive meal, and the side panels depicting acts of charity, such as clothing the poor and feeding the hungry. The card bore the message **\"A Merry Christmas and A Happy New Year To You.\"**\n\n### Production and Reception:\nAbout 1,000 copies of the card were printed and sold for a shilling each, which was quite expensive at the time. The card sparked some controversy because the central image depicted a child drinking wine, which some Victorians considered inappropriate. Nevertheless, the card was a success and marked the beginning of the tradition of sending Christmas cards.\n\n### Legacy:\nThe invention of the Christmas card is considered one of Sir Henry Cole's contributions to Victorian society, alongside his work on the Great Exhibition of 1851 and his role in founding the **Victoria and Albert Museum**.

One of the most notable examples of Civil War-era submarines is the **H.L. Hunley**, a Confederate submarine that became the first combat submarine to successfully sink an enemy warship. The H.L. Hunley was designed and built by a team led by **Horace Lawson Hunley**, a New Orleans lawyer and marine engineer, along with engineers James McClintock and Baxter Watson.\n\n### Development of the H.L. Hunley:\n- The H.L. Hunley was built in 1863 by the Confederate forces during the Civil War as part of their effort to break through the Union Navy's blockade of southern ports.\n- The submarine was a hand-cranked, cylindrical vessel made primarily of iron and measured about 40 feet long. It was operated by a crew of eight men, seven of whom turned a crankshaft to propel the vessel, while the eighth man steered and controlled the sub.\n\n### The Hunley's Historic Mission:\nOn February 17, 1864, the H.L. Hunley successfully attacked and sank the USS Housatonic, a Union warship, by attaching a spar torpedo (a bomb mounted on a long pole) to the ship's hull. The torpedo detonated, sinking the Housatonic. Unfortunately, the Hunley also sank shortly after the attack, killing its entire crew. The reasons for its sinking remain a topic of speculation and study.\n\n### Legacy:\nWhile the H.L. Hunley was not the first submarine ever built (submarines like the **Turtle**, designed by David Bushnell in 1775 during the American Revolutionary War, predate it), it was the first to achieve a successful combat mission. The Hunley's achievements marked an important milestone in submarine warfare and naval engineering, influencing the development of modern submarines.\n\nThe wreck of the H.L. Hunley was discovered in 1995 off the coast of Charleston, South Carolina, and was raised from the ocean floor in 2000. It is currently preserved and studied at a conservation facility in Charleston.","em":1,"f1":1.0}

It typically becomes noticeable in people over the age of 40 and is caused by a loss of flexibility in the lens of the eye. As the lens becomes stiffer and less elastic, it becomes more difficult to focus on close-up objects.\n\nThere are several ways to manage or correct presbyopia, depending on your preferences, lifestyle, and the severity of the condition. Here's an overview of the most common approaches:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Prescription Eyeglasses**\nEyeglasses are the most common and simplest way to correct presbyopia. Options include:\n- **Reading glasses**: Non-prescription or prescription glasses used for close-up activities such as reading or using a smartphone.\n- **Bifocal lenses**: These have two distinct optical powers, with the upper part for distance vision and the lower part for near vision.\n- **Trifocal lenses**: These have three fields of vision\u2014for near, intermediate, and distant vision.\n- **Progressive lenses**: These provide a gradual transition between different lens powers for near, intermediate, and distance vision, without the visible lines seen in bifocals or trifocals.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Contact Lenses**\nFor those who prefer not to wear glasses, contact lenses are another option:\n- **Monovision contact lenses**: One lens is prescribed for distance vision (usually for the dominant eye), and the other for near vision.\n- **Multifocal contact lenses**: These lenses offer multiple zones for distance, intermediate, and near vision.\n- **Modified monovision**: A combination of multifocal lenses in one eye and a single-vision lens in the other.\n\nIt may take time for the brain to adjust to these lenses, but many people find them effective.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Refractive Surgery**\nSurgical options can also be considered for permanent correction of presbyopia. These include:\n- **LASIK (Laser-Assisted In Situ Keratomileusis)**: Monovision LASIK can correct one eye for distance vision and the other for near vision.\n- **Conductive keratoplasty (CK)**: A non-laser surgical technique that uses radiofrequency energy to reshape the cornea and improve near vision. However, the effects may diminish over time.\n- **Refractive lens exchange (RLE)**: Similar to cataract surgery, this involves replacing the eye's natural lens with an artificial intraocular lens (IOL). Multifocal or accommodating IOLs can be used to address presbyopia.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Corneal Inlays**\nA corneal inlay is a small device implanted in the cornea of one eye to improve near vision. It works by altering the way light enters the eye and focuses on the retina. Examples include:\n- **KAMRA inlay**: Creates a pinhole effect to improve near vision while maintaining distance vision.\n- **Raindrop inlay**: Changes the curvature of the cornea to improve near focus.\n\nThese procedures are generally recommended for people who do not want to rely on glasses or contact lenses.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Lifestyle Adjustments**\n- **Proper lighting**: Ensure good lighting when reading or doing close-up work, as presbyopia can make it harder to see in dim conditions.\n- **Take breaks**: Follow the 20-20-20 rule when using screens\u2014every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds to reduce eye strain.\n- **Magnifying tools**: For tasks like sewing or detailed craftsmanship, magnifying lenses or reading aids can be helpful.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Experimental and Emerging Treatments**\nResearch is ongoing for new treatments for presbyopia. For example:\n- **Eye drops for presbyopia**: FDA-approved drops like Vuity (pilocarpine) can temporarily improve near vision by constricting the pupil, creating a pinhole effect to enhance depth of focus.\n- **Lens-softening techniques**: Experimental therapies aim to restore the flexibility of the natural lens to treat presbyopia.\n\n---\n\n### **Consult an Eye Care Professional**\nIt's important to visit an optometrist or ophthalmologist to determine the best correction method for you. They can assess your vision, discuss your lifestyle needs, and recommend the most suitable treatment.\n\nPresbyopia is a natural part of aging, but with the wide range of solutions available today, it can be effectively managed to maintain your quality of life.","em":0,"f1":0.2857142857}

The preparation required incredible ingenuity and determination, as they had to pull the heavy steel cable across the gap using a bow and arrow with fishing line.\n\n### The Aftermath\nAfter completing his walk, Petit was arrested by the police. However, the charges were later dropped in exchange for him performing a free high-wire act for children in Central Park. The Twin Towers stunt brought Petit international fame, and he became celebrated as one of the greatest high-wire artists of all time.\n\n### Legacy\nPhilippe Petit's walk has been immortalized in various forms of media:\n- In 2008, a documentary called **\"Man on Wire\"** was released, detailing the event. It was critically acclaimed and won the **Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature**.\n- In 2015, a dramatized film titled **\"The Walk\"**, directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Petit, was released. The film used stunning visual effects to recreate the daring walk.\n\nPhilippe Petit\u2019s bold and poetic act is often viewed as a symbol of human ambition and artistry. His walk is remembered not just as a stunt, but as a profound artistic statement that captured the imagination of people around the world.","em":1,"f1":1.0}

The city, established in the 12th century, rose to prominence during the 14th and 15th centuries as part of the Mali Empire, which was one of the most powerful and wealthy empires in African history.\n\nHere\u2019s a detailed breakdown of Timbuktu\u2019s significance during the Mali Empire:\n\n### 1. **Center of Trade**\nTimbuktu was a key stop along the trans-Saharan trade routes, connecting North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa. It became a hub for the exchange of goods such as gold, salt, ivory, and slaves. The Mali Empire was rich in gold, and Timbuktu played a central role in the empire\u2019s trade network, attracting merchants from across the Islamic world and beyond.\n\n### 2. **Islamic Learning and Scholarship**\nTimbuktu became a renowned intellectual and spiritual center under the Mali Empire, particularly during the reign of **Mansa Musa** (1312\u20131337), one of the richest and most powerful emperors in history. Mansa Musa was a devout Muslim who invested in the city\u2019s development, building mosques, libraries, and universities.\n\n   - The **Sankore University** and its associated **Sankore Mosque** in Timbuktu became famous centers of Islamic learning. Scholars studied subjects ranging from theology and law to astronomy, medicine, and mathematics.\n   - Timbuktu attracted scholars, poets, and students from across the Islamic world, and its libraries housed thousands of manuscripts, many of which survive today as the **Timbuktu Manuscripts**.\n\n### 3. **Cultural and Religious Influence**\nIslam played a significant role in shaping the culture of Timbuktu under the Mali Empire. Islamic teachings influenced governance, education, and daily life. Timbuktu also became a center for the dissemination of Islamic culture throughout West Africa, contributing to the region\u2019s rich cultural heritage.\n\n### 4. **Urban Development**\nTimbuktu was known for its impressive architecture, particularly its mosques, such as the **Djinguereber Mosque**, which was built during Mansa Musa\u2019s reign. These structures, made of mudbrick and timber, are iconic examples of Sudano-Sahelian architecture and remain landmarks of the city today.\n\n### 5. **Role in the Mali Empire's Wealth**\nThe Mali Empire was one of the wealthiest empires of its time, largely due to its control of gold mines and trade routes. Timbuktu\u2019s location made it a strategic city for managing and expanding the empire\u2019s wealth. The city\u2019s prosperity attracted traders, scholars, and explorers, further enhancing its reputation as a beacon of wealth and knowledge.\n\n### Decline\nWhile Timbuktu flourished under the Mali Empire, its importance began to wane after the empire\u2019s decline in the 15th century. It later came under the control of the **Songhai Empire**, which continued its legacy as a center of trade and learning.\n\nIn summary, Timbuktu under the Mali Empire can best be described as a flourishing hub of trade, Islamic scholarship, and cultural exchange, renowned for its wealth, intellectual achievements, and contributions to the spread of Islam in West Africa. Its legacy as a center of learning and trade has cemented its place in history as one of Africa\u2019s most iconic cities.","em":0,"f1":0.4285714286}

Without clarifying the context, the answer could vary significantly. For example, in gaming, \"hp\" often stands for \"health points,\" but in other contexts, it might have a different definition.","model_short_answer":["HP in War and Order stands for 'Hit Points,' representing the health or durability of a unit or building."],"model_long_answer":"In the mobile strategy game **War and Order**, the term **HP** refers to **Hit Points** or **Health Points**. It is a common term in gaming that represents the amount of health or durability a unit, building, or character has. In this specific game, HP is primarily associated with your troops and buildings, dictating how much damage they can withstand before being defeated or destroyed.\n\n### HP in Troops:\n- Each type of troop in War and Order, such as infantry, cavalry, archers, or mages, has a specific amount of HP.\n- Troop HP determines how much damage a unit can take during battles. For example, infantry units typically have higher HP than other units because they are designed to act as tanks, absorbing damage to protect other units like mages or archers.\n- Upgrading your troops to higher tiers (Tiers 1 to 13) or researching technologies in the Academy increases their HP.\n\n### HP in Buildings:\n- Buildings like your **Castle**, **Wall**, and other key structures also have HP. If an enemy attacks your city, the HP of these buildings determines how long they can withstand the assault before being damaged or destroyed.\n- You can increase building HP through upgrades and specific buffs.\n\n### Buffing Troop HP:\nIn War and Order, you can improve your troops' HP through several methods:\n1. **Technology Research**: Researching specific technologies in the Academy can increase troop HP. For example, the \"Infantry Defense\" or general \"Troop Defense\/HP\" research lines can improve survivability.\n2. **Equipment**: Equipping your Lord with gear that boosts troop stats can increase HP.\n3. **Beasts**: The Beast system allows you to enhance your army's stats. Certain Beasts and their skills can improve troop HP.\n4. **Alliance Technology**: If you\u2019re part of an active alliance, contributing to alliance technology can unlock buffs that increase troop HP.\n5. **Buff Items**: Temporary items or boosts can be used before a major battle to enhance your troops' HP for a limited time.\n\n### Why is HP Important in War and Order?\n- **Survivability in Battle**: Higher HP allows your troops to survive longer in battles, giving them more time to deal damage to the enemy.\n- **Reducing Losses**: Troops that survive battles due to higher HP are less likely to die, which reduces the cost and time required to train replacements.\n- **Strategic Advantage**: In PvP battles or monster hunts, armies with higher HP can endure longer, often outlasting opponents with weaker stats.\n\nBy increasing your army's HP and balancing it with other stats like attack and defense, you can create stronger, more resilient forces in War and Order.","em":0,"f1":0.3636363636}

The cost to play there depends on whether you are a member, a guest of a member, or participating in a special event like the Masters Tournament.\n\n### Membership at Augusta National\nMembership at Augusta National is extremely exclusive, and invitations are extended only to select individuals. The club does not publicly disclose the cost of membership, but estimates suggest:\n- **Initiation fee**: Around $40,000 (as of recent estimates; this is significantly less expensive than many other elite golf clubs).\n- **Annual dues**: Around $5,000 to $10,000.\n\nFor members, there is no additional cost to play a round of golf, as it is included in their membership.\n\n### Playing as a Guest\nNon-members can only play at Augusta National if they are invited by a member. If you are fortunate enough to be invited as a guest, the member covering your round will pay for the green fee, which is reportedly around **$40 to $50 per round**. This is remarkably low compared to other top-tier golf courses, but it reflects the club's philosophy of prioritizing exclusivity and tradition over making money. \n\n### Playing During the Masters Tournament\nThe Masters Tournament, held annually at Augusta National in April, is one of the four major championships in professional golf. However, the course is not open to the public for play during the event. Spectators can purchase tickets to attend the tournament, but playing the course during the Masters is not an option. \n\n### Other Ways to Play Augusta National\nFor most golfers, the opportunity to play Augusta National is more about luck or connections than money. Here are a few rare opportunities to play the course:\n1. **Media Lottery**: Members of the media who cover the Masters Tournament may be selected through a lottery system to play a round of golf on the Monday after the tournament. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for journalists.\n2. **Amateur Events**: Some amateur golfers (e.g., winners of certain prestigious amateur tournaments) may earn invitations to play at Augusta National as part of their qualification for the Masters.\n3. **Corporate or Charitable Events**: Occasionally, Augusta National allows special events that may include rounds of golf, but these are rare and typically reserved for high-level sponsorship or charity participants.\n\n### Summary\n- Membership costs: $40,000 initiation fee + $5,000\u2013$10,000 annual dues.\n- Guest green fee: $40\u2013$50 (only accessible if invited by a member).\n- Public access: Not available outside of extremely rare circumstances.\n- Masters tickets (for spectating): Around $140 for daily practice rounds or tournament days, but obtaining tickets is highly competitive.\n\nGiven its exclusivity, Augusta National's allure lies not in the cost but in the rarity of the opportunity to play there. For most golfers, playing Augusta National remains a dream rather than a practical possibility.","em":0,"f1":0.3}

Historically, poverty rates have been higher among:\n- Racial and ethnic minorities, such as Black and Hispanic populations.\n- Children, who tend to have a higher poverty rate than the general population.\n- Individuals living in rural areas compared to those in urban areas.\n\nFor the latest and most detailed statistics, you can visit the [U.S. Census Bureau's Poverty Data page](https:\/\/www.census.gov\/topics\/income-poverty\/poverty.html).","em":0,"f1":0.0}

The \"first pick\" of FA Cup games typically refers to the process by which broadcasters select which matches they want to televise live.\n\n### **How FA Cup Game Picks Work**\nThe FA Cup broadcast rights are often shared between multiple broadcasters, and in recent years (as of 2023), these rights in the UK have been held by **BBC Sport** and **ITV Sport**. Both broadcasters work with the Football Association (FA) to determine which matches will be shown live on television. Here's how the process generally works:\n\n1. **First Pick for Games**: \n   - Each broadcaster is typically assigned a certain number of \"picks\" per round as part of their agreement. The broadcaster with the \"first pick\" gets to choose the game they feel will attract the largest audience or generate the most interest. \n   - For example, a clash between two Premier League clubs, a \"David vs. Goliath\" matchup (where a lower-league team faces a top-flight team), or a game with historical rivalries is usually chosen first.\n\n2. **Subsequent Picks**: \n   - After the first pick is made, the other broadcaster(s) will take turns selecting additional games. The number of picks depends on the specific broadcasting deal in place.\n   - For instance, if the BBC has the first pick in one round, ITV might get the first pick in the next round, ensuring fairness over the course of the tournament.\n\n3. **Broadcasting Agreements**:\n   - The **BBC** (a public broadcaster) typically focuses on airing matches on free-to-air television, making the games accessible to a wide audience. \n   - **ITV**, a commercial broadcaster, also offers free-to-air coverage but may have different priorities when selecting games to showcase.\n\n4. **Scheduling Considerations**:\n   - Once games are selected, their timing may be adjusted to fit broadcast schedules. For example, games chosen for live TV might be moved to Friday evening, Saturday lunchtime, Sunday afternoon, or Monday evening to accommodate viewers.\n\n5. **Non-Televised Matches**:\n   - Matches not selected for live television in the UK are often still available for streaming or highlights coverage, depending on the arrangements for that specific season.\n\n### **International Broadcasting**\nOutside the UK, different broadcasters hold the rights to show FA Cup matches. These broadcasters may also have the ability to choose which games to air, but they usually rely on the games already selected for UK television as a starting point.\n\n### **Why Certain Games Are Picked**\nTelevision broadcasters aim to maximize viewership, so they prioritize matches that are likely to draw the most attention. Factors influencing selection include:\n- The teams involved (e.g., Manchester United, Liverpool, or Arsenal games are often prioritized due to their large fanbases).\n- The potential for an upset (e.g., non-league teams facing top-tier opponents).\n- Local or historical rivalries.\n- Star players who attract global interest.\n\n### **Recent Trends**\nIn recent years, there has been criticism that broadcasters often overlook smaller clubs in favor of \"big name\" teams. However, broadcasters also recognize the magic of the FA Cup and the appeal of underdog stories, so they often try to balance their choices to include lower-division teams or non-league sides when they are involved in compelling matchups.\n\n### **Summary**\nThe first pick of FA Cup games is determined by broadcasting agreements, with the BBC and ITV alternating priority selections by round. The chosen games are typically those expected to attract the most interest, whether due to the teams involved, the potential for an upset, or historical significance. This process ensures the competition is accessible to a wide audience while highlighting the drama and unpredictability that make the FA Cup special.","em":0,"f1":0.1666666667}

Paramount+ confirmed that this would be the last season, focusing on Captain Michael Burnham and her crew's adventures in the far future.\n\n2. **Star Trek: Strange New Worlds**  \n   Season 2 of *Strange New Worlds* concluded in August 2023. Paramount+ announced that Season 3 is in development, but production was delayed due to the Writers Guild of America (WGA) strike and Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) strike in 2023. A release date for Season 3 has not been confirmed, but it is unlikely to premiere before late 2024 or 2025.\n\n3. **Star Trek: Lower Decks**  \n   The animated series *Star Trek: Lower Decks* is currently in its fourth season, which began airing on September 7, 2023.

{"question":"what is the number of true positives (tp)","short_answers":["the proportion of positives that are correctly identified as such"],"long_answer":" Sensitivity ( also called the true positive rate , the recall , or probability of detection in some fields ) measures the proportion of positives that are correctly identified as such ( e.g. the percentage of sick people who are correctly identified as having the condition ) . ","category":"Missing necessary components","judgment":"underspecified","reasoning":"The request is underspecified because the term \"true positives (tp)\" is a statistical metric that depends on a specific dataset, model, or context. Without providing the data or the scenario (e.g., a classification task, dataset, or model predictions), it is impossible to determine the numerical value of true positives. The question lacks the necessary components to compute or reference a specific value.","model_short_answer":["The number of true positives (TP) is the count of instances correctly predicted as positive by a model."],"model_long_answer":"The term **True Positives (TP)** is used in the context of classification problems and machine learning, particularly in evaluating the performance of a model. It refers to the number of instances where the model correctly predicts the positive class in a binary classification task.\n\n### Definition of True Positives (TP)\nA true positive occurs when:\n- The actual class of the data point is **positive** (e.g., \"yes,\" \"disease present,\" \"spam email\").\n- The model also predicts the class as **positive**.\n\nIn other words, **TP** is the count of cases where the model\u2019s prediction matches the actual positive label.\n\n#### Example:\nImagine a binary classification problem to detect whether an email is spam or not. Here:\n- Positive Class: \"Spam\"\n- Negative Class: \"Not Spam\"\n\nIf the actual email is \"Spam\" (positive class) and the model predicts \"Spam,\" this is a **True Positive**.\n\n---\n\n### Formula for True Positives:\nThe number of true positives is not calculated directly but is derived from the confusion matrix. A **confusion matrix** is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model, and it typically contains the following:\n\n|                 | Predicted Positive | Predicted Negative |\n|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Actual Positive | True Positives (TP)| False Negatives (FN)|\n| Actual Negative | False Positives (FP)| True Negatives (TN)|\n\n- **True Positives (TP):** Correctly predicted positive cases.\n- **False Positives (FP):** Incorrectly predicted positive cases (predicted positive, but actually negative).\n- **True Negatives (TN):** Correctly predicted negative cases.\n- **False Negatives (FN):** Incorrectly predicted negative cases (predicted negative, but actually positive).\n\nThus, the count of **TP** is simply the number of cases that fall into the \"Actual Positive and Predicted Positive\" category in the confusion matrix.\n\n---\n\n### Related Metrics That Use TP:\n1. **Precision (Positive Predictive Value):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Precision} = \\frac{\\text{TP}}{\\text{TP} + \\text{FP}}\n   \\]\n   Precision measures how many of the predicted positive cases are actually positive.\n\n2. **Recall (Sensitivity or True Positive Rate):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Recall} = \\frac{\\text{TP}}{\\text{TP} + \\text{FN}}\n   \\]\n   Recall measures how many of the actual positive cases are correctly identified.\n\n3. **F1 Score:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{F1 Score} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\text{Precision} \\cdot \\text{Recall}}{\\text{Precision} + \\text{Recall}}\n   \\]\n   The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing the two.\n\n4. **Accuracy:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Accuracy} = \\frac{\\text{TP} + \\text{TN}}{\\text{TP} + \\text{TN} + \\text{FP} + \\text{FN}}\n   \\]\n   Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the model.\n\n---\n\n### Contextual Importance of True Positives\nIn real-world applications, the number of true positives is critical for tasks where identifying the positive class is the primary goal. For instance:\n- In medical diagnosis, detecting a disease (true positives) is crucial to ensuring proper treatment.\n- In fraud detection, identifying fraudulent transactions (true positives) can save financial institutions from losses.\n- In spam email classification, correctly labeling spam emails reduces user burden.\n\nIf the true positive count is low, it may indicate that the model struggles with identifying the positive class, which could lead to a high number of false negatives (missed detections).\n\nBy analyzing the number of true positives alongside other metrics, data scientists and machine learning practitioners can refine their models to improve performance.","em":0,"f1":0.3333333333}

She joined the panel in January 2020 but left after six months, citing concerns about the lack of creative freedom and the inability of the show's environment to address important cultural topics.\n\n7. **Garcelle Beauvais** (2020\u20132022): Garcelle, an actress and former model, joined the show in 2020. She is known for her roles in *The Jamie Foxx Show* and *The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills*. Garcelle brought a fresh perspective to the show in its later years.\n\n### The End of \"The Real\"\nAfter eight seasons, *The Real* was officially canceled in April 2022. The cancellation was attributed to factors like declining ratings and production costs. The show was praised for its groundbreaking approach to daytime television, particularly for featuring a diverse group of women and tackling topics often ignored in traditional talk show formats.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in specific episodes, co-host dynamics, or notable moments, I\u2019d be happy to provide more details!","em":1,"f1":1.0}

","category":"Missing necessary components","judgment":"underspecified","reasoning":"The request is underspecified because the term \"good\" is too general and lacks context. Without specifying the two goods being compared (e.g., \"tea vs. coffee\" or \"apple vs. banana\"), the question cannot determine the specific substitute relationship. Additionally, the concept of \"good\" in economics is well-defined, but the lack of context makes the referent ambiguous.","model_short_answer":["Substitute good"],"model_long_answer":"A good that can be used in place of another good is called a **substitute good**. Substitute goods serve similar purposes and can satisfy the same consumer need, meaning that if the price of one good increases, demand for its substitute is likely to rise. This economic concept is based on the idea that consumers will opt for the more affordable or accessible alternative when two goods are interchangeable.\n\n### Examples of Substitute Goods:\n1. **Butter and Margarine**: If the price of butter increases, consumers may switch to margarine as a substitute.\n2. **Tea and Coffee**: Both can fulfill the need for a hot caffeinated drink, so a rise in the price of tea could lead to an increase in demand for coffee.\n3. **Coca-Cola and Pepsi**: These two soft drinks are commonly seen as substitutes for each other.\n4. **Gasoline and Electric Cars**: With rising fuel prices, some consumers might consider electric vehicles as an alternative.\n\n### Key Characteristics of Substitute Goods:\n- **Positive Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand**: The relationship between two substitute goods is often measured through their cross-price elasticity of demand. If the price of one good rises, the demand for its substitute increases, showing a positive relationship.\n- **Degree of Substitutability**: Not all substitutes are perfect. For example, while butter and margarine are close substitutes, tea and coffee might not be perfect substitutes because consumer preferences may differ significantly between them.\n\n### Importance in Economics:\nSubstitute goods play a crucial role in understanding consumer behavior and market dynamics. Businesses often monitor their competitors' prices because changes can directly influence their own sales. Moreover, governments and economists use the concept to analyze competition and market efficiency.\n\nFor further reading, you can explore the topic of substitute goods in microeconomics on [Wikipedia's article on Substitute Goods](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Substitute_good).

Her character goes through significant ups and downs over the course of the series, including her departure and eventual return. Here is a breakdown of when Jenny leaves and comes back to the show:\n\n### Jenny's Departure\nJenny leaves the Upper East Side in **Season 3, Episode 22 (\"Last Tango, Then Paris\")** after a dramatic series of events. This includes her fallout with Blair Waldorf, her reputation being tarnished, and a scandal involving her sleeping with Chuck Bass. At the end of the episode, Jenny decides to leave the city to live with her mother in Hudson, New York, as a way to escape the toxic environment of Manhattan and focus on herself.\n\n### Jenny's Return\nJenny makes a few guest appearances after her initial departure in Season 3:\n\n1. **Season 4, Episode 6 (\"Easy J\")**: Jenny returns to the Upper East Side briefly in this episode.

The referent is unclear due to potential confusion between the game title, console, or series details. Without clarification, the question remains ambiguous.","model_short_answer":["The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky the 3rd is not officially available on PlayStation Vita. It is primarily available on PC and PSP."],"model_long_answer":"\"The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky the 3rd\" is the third installment in the \"Trails in the Sky\" subseries, which is part of the larger \"The Legend of Heroes\" franchise. Developed by Nihon Falcom, the game originally released in Japan for Microsoft Windows in 2007 and later for the PlayStation Portable (PSP). While the game was not officially released on the PlayStation Vita, it can be played on the Vita through the PSP's backward compatibility feature.\n\n### Overview of \"Trails in the Sky the 3rd\"\n\n1. **Genre and Gameplay:**\n   - \"Trails in the Sky the 3rd\" is a story-rich role-playing game (RPG) featuring turn-based combat and an intricate narrative. It continues the series' tradition of deep character development, world-building, and strategic battles.\n   - Unlike its predecessors, which focused more on an overarching adventure and political intrigue, \"The 3rd\" shifts to a more dungeon-crawling format with episodic storytelling. Players explore the \"Phantasma,\" a mysterious realm, while uncovering character backstories and resolving lingering plotlines from the first two games.\n\n2. **Protagonist:**\n   - The game introduces a new protagonist, **Kevin Graham**, a priest from the Septian Church who had a supporting role in the previous games. Kevin's past and personal journey take center stage in this installment, giving the story a darker and more introspective tone.\n\n3. **Setting:**\n   - The game is set in a surreal, otherworldly dimension called the Phantasma, which serves as a stage for the game's story and battles. While it doesn't focus as much on the political and regional conflicts of the Liberl Kingdom (the setting of the first two games), it does provide closure to many character arcs and unresolved mysteries.\n\n4. **Episodic Structure:**\n   - \"Trails in the Sky the 3rd\" introduces \"doors,\" which are optional side stories that provide additional lore, backstories, and world-building. These doors are a unique feature of the game and are highly praised for their emotional depth and insight into the series' characters.\n\n### The Game on PlayStation Vita\n\nAlthough \"Trails in the Sky the 3rd\" was not specifically developed for the PlayStation Vita, it can be played on the system through the following methods:\n\n1. **PSP Backward Compatibility:**\n   - The PlayStation Vita is backward compatible with most PSP games purchased digitally from the PlayStation Store. If you own the PSP version of \"Trails in the Sky the 3rd,\" you can download and play it on your Vita.\n\n2. **Availability in the West:**\n   - The English release of \"The 3rd\" was localized by XSEED Games and became available on Steam, GOG, and the Humble Store in 2017 for PC. Unfortunately, the PSP version of \"The 3rd\" was never officially localized for Western audiences, meaning Vita users outside of Japan cannot access it through the PlayStation Store. However, Japanese players with access to the Japanese PlayStation Store can purchase and play the PSP version on their Vita.\n\n### Importance in the Series\n\n\"The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky the 3rd\" is a critical entry in the series, as it bridges the gap between the \"Trails in the Sky\" trilogy and the subsequent \"Trails\" games, such as the \"Trails of Cold Steel\" subseries. It provides essential background information about the overarching storylines involving the Septian Church, ancient artifacts, and the mysterious Ouroboros organization.\n\nFans of the series often recommend playing \"The 3rd\" to fully appreciate the lore and character development before moving on to later entries in the franchise.\n\n### Summary\n\nWhile \"Trails in the Sky the 3rd\" is not natively available on the PlayStation Vita, it can be played on the device via PSP backward compatibility if you have access to the Japanese version. For English-speaking players, the game is primarily available on PC platforms. Its unique storytelling approach, darker tone, and focus on character-driven narratives make it a memorable and important entry in the \"Trails\" series. If you're a fan of the franchise, it's worth exploring, especially if you're interested in the lore and characters that tie the series together.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

This system is distinct from the **metric system**, which is used by most other countries around the world. However, the metric system is also used in certain contexts in the U.S., leading to a dual system in some areas.\n\n### Key Features of the U.S. Customary System\nThe U.S. customary system includes units such as:\n- **Length**: Inches, feet, yards, and miles\n- **Weight\/Mass**: Ounces, pounds, and tons\n- **Volume**: Teaspoons, tablespoons, fluid ounces, cups, pints, quarts, and gallons\n- **Temperature**: Degrees Fahrenheit\n\n### Use of the Metric System in the U.S.\nAlthough the U.S. predominantly uses the customary system, the metric system is widely used in specific fields, such as:\n- **Science and Medicine**: Scientists, engineers, and medical professionals almost exclusively use the metric system for precision and international standardization.\n- **Global Trade and Manufacturing**: Many U.S.-manufactured products (like cars and electronics) are designed according to metric specifications to align with global standards.\n- **Government and Military**: Some federal agencies and the military use the metric system for consistency with international allies and partners.\n- **Education**: The metric system is taught in schools alongside the customary system.\n\n### History of Metrication in the U.S.\nThe U.S. has not fully transitioned to the metric system, despite efforts in the past:\n- In **1866**, Congress passed the Metric Act, legalizing the use of the metric system in the U.S.\n- In the **1970s**, the government initiated the Metric Conversion Act (1975), aiming to increase metric usage.

This happens due to the way light rays are reflected off the surface of the concave mirror. Let me explain this process in detail:\n\n### How a Concave Mirror Forms a Real Image:\n1. **Nature of Concave Mirrors**: A concave mirror has a reflective surface that curves inward, resembling the inner surface of a sphere. This curvature allows it to converge light rays that are reflected off its surface.\n\n2. **Image Formation**:\n   - When light rays from an object hit the concave mirror, they are reflected according to the **law of reflection** (the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection).\n   - The reflected rays converge at a specific point, called the **focus (F)**, which is located on the mirror\u2019s principal axis.\n\n3. **Conditions for a Real Image**:\n   - A real image is formed when the object is placed **beyond the focal point (F)** of the concave mirror.\n   - The reflected light rays actually converge at a point in front of the mirror, creating a real, inverted image that can be projected onto a screen.\n\n4. **Characteristics of the Real Image**:\n   - **Inverted**: The real image is upside down in relation to the object.\n   - **Size**: The size of the image depends on the object\u2019s distance from the mirror:\n     - If the object is far beyond the center of curvature (C), the image will be smaller than the object.\n     - If the object is at the center of curvature, the image will be the same size as the object.\n     - If the object is between the center of curvature and the focal point, the image will be larger than the object.\n   - **Position**: The image appears on the same side of the mirror as the object and can be projected onto a screen.\n\n5. **Key Points About the Mirror's Geometry**:\n   - **Principal Axis**: An imaginary line passing through the mirror's center and the middle of its surface.\n   - **Focal Point (F)**: The point where parallel rays of light converge after being reflected.\n   - **Center of Curvature (C)**: The center of the sphere from which the mirror is a segment.\n   - **Focal Length (f)**: The distance between the focal point and the mirror's surface.\n\n### Examples of Real Images in Real Life:\n- **Projection in Telescopes**: Concave mirrors are often used in reflecting telescopes to create real images of distant stars or planets.\n- **Headlights in Cars**: Concave mirrors focus light to form a beam, which is the reverse of their ability to form real images.\n- **Solar Concentrators**: Concave mirrors focus sunlight to a point (real image), which can then be used for heating or energy generation.\n\n### Contrast with Virtual Images:\n- If the object is placed **closer to the mirror than the focal point**, the concave mirror forms a **virtual image**. This image is upright, magnified, and cannot be projected onto a screen because the light rays do not actually converge; they only appear to do so when extended backward.\n\nIn summary, a concave mirror forms a real image when the object is beyond the focal point. This image is an inverted, scaled copy of the object, and its size and position depend on the object's distance from the mirror.","em":0,"f1":0.1666666667}

Rostow\u2019s stages of growth, Paul Rosenstein-Rodan\u2019s hypothesis, or other development economists). Without clarifying which specific theory or individual is being referenced, the question lacks a clear referent and depends on contextual knowledge that is not explicitly provided.","model_short_answer":["Albert O. Hirschman"],"model_long_answer":"The theory of unbalanced economic growth was primarily given and developed by **Albert O. Hirschman**, a prominent economist and social scientist. Hirschman introduced this concept in his influential work, particularly in his 1958 book, *The Strategy of Economic Development*. The theory challenged the prevailing belief at the time that balanced growth was the only viable approach to economic development.\n\n### Context of Hirschman\u2019s Theory\nIn the mid-20th century, economic development theorists were debating how underdeveloped countries could best achieve sustained growth. The dominant view, known as the **balanced growth theory**, argued that economies needed to invest equally across all sectors to develop harmoniously. This was championed by economists like Ragnar Nurkse, who believed that simultaneous investments in various industries would overcome bottlenecks and create a self-sustaining cycle of demand.\n\nHirschman, however, argued that **unbalanced growth** could often be more effective, especially in developing countries with scarce resources. He believed that deliberately creating imbalances in the economy\u2014by investing in specific key sectors\u2014would stimulate growth by forcing other sectors to adapt and grow in response. \n\n### Key Ideas of the Theory of Unbalanced Growth\n1. **Scarcity of Resources:** Hirschman pointed out that developing economies often do not have sufficient resources (capital, skilled labor, etc.) to pursue balanced, simultaneous investments across all sectors. Attempting balanced growth might dilute these limited resources and slow down development.\n\n2. **Investment in Leading Sectors:** Hirschman argued for focusing investment in certain \"leading sectors\" or industries that could generate the highest returns and have the greatest potential to stimulate growth in related sectors. This would create a \"chain reaction\" of economic activity.\n\n3. **Forward and Backward Linkages:** A key part of Hirschman\u2019s theory was the idea of **linkages**:\n   - **Backward Linkages:** Investments in a particular industry create demand for inputs from other industries. For example, growth in the automobile industry would increase demand for steel, rubber, and glass.\n   - **Forward Linkages:** Investments in an industry can stimulate the development of industries that use its output. For instance, the steel industry\u2019s growth may support the construction and machinery sectors.\n\n4. **Pressure to Develop:** Unbalanced growth creates economic pressures that force other parts of the economy to develop in order to keep up. For example, a booming industrial sector might lead to increased demand for infrastructure, transportation, and education, thereby driving growth in these areas.\n\n### Implications for Policy\nHirschman\u2019s theory suggested that policymakers in developing countries should identify and strategically invest in sectors with the strongest potential for linkages and growth. This approach contrasts with the idea of spreading investments evenly across all sectors. \n\nHis theory also emphasized the importance of entrepreneurial innovation and the government\u2019s role in directing resources to where they could have the greatest impact.\n\n### Criticism of the Theory\nWhile the theory of unbalanced growth has been influential, it has also faced criticism:\n- Critics argue that it could lead to unsustainable growth patterns or exacerbate inequality by favoring certain sectors or regions over others.\n- Some economists believe that unbalanced growth strategies may overlook the importance of basic infrastructure, education, and health systems, which are necessary for long-term development.\n- The success of unbalanced growth depends heavily on effective governance and the ability of policymakers to choose the right sectors for investment, which is not always guaranteed.\n\n### Relevance Today\nHirschman\u2019s ideas remain relevant, especially in discussions about how to prioritize investments in developing economies. His emphasis on the dynamic, interconnected nature of economic systems has influenced modern development strategies, including industrial policy and sectoral planning.\n\nIn summary, **Albert O. Hirschman** was the key proponent of the theory of unbalanced economic growth, which advocated for targeted investments in leading sectors to stimulate overall economic development through linkages and induced pressures. This theory remains a cornerstone in the field of development economics.","em":0,"f1":0.5}

Without this context, the answer could vary significantly depending on the criteria used.","model_short_answer":["Tavius Robinson (Ole Miss) - 2023 season leader"],"model_long_answer":"In NCAA college football, the record for the most career sacks is held by **Derrick Thomas**, who played for the University of Alabama from 1985 to 1988. Thomas recorded an astounding **52 sacks** during his collegiate career, a mark that still stands as the NCAA record to this day.\n\nThomas's most dominant season came in 1988, when he notched **27 sacks in a single season**, another record that remains unbroken. His incredible pass-rushing ability helped him earn unanimous All-American honors and the prestigious Butkus Award (given to the nation's top linebacker) in his senior year.\n\n### Derrick Thomas's Legacy:\nThomas's performance in college made him one of the most feared defenders in college football history. After his time at Alabama, he was selected fourth overall in the 1989 NFL Draft by the Kansas City Chiefs. He went on to have a Hall of Fame career in the NFL, earning nine Pro Bowl selections.\n\n### Modern Context:\nWhile Thomas's career and single-season sack records are unlikely to be broken, other players have come close to his dominance in recent years. For example:\n- **Terrell Suggs** (Arizona State) had 24 sacks in 2002, the second-highest single-season total in NCAA history.\n- Players like Von Miller, Chase Young, and Jadeveon Clowney also had impressive sack totals during their college careers, but none reached Thomas's record.\n\nIt's important to note that sack statistics were not officially tracked by the NCAA until **2000**, so many older players' numbers (like Derrick Thomas's) are based on historical records from their schools and other sources.\n\nFor updated statistics on sack leaders, you can look at the NCAA's official website or follow college football season updates, as sack totals are a key metric for defensive performance.","em":0,"f1":0.0}
{"question":"when did university stop being free in australia","short_answers":["1989"],"long_answer":" In 1989 , the Hawke Labor Government began gradually re-introducing fees for university study . It set up the Higher Education Contributions Scheme ( HECS ) , which was first proposed by Professor Murray Wells and subsequently developed by economist and lecturer at the Australian National University , Bruce Chapman and championed by Education Minister John Dawkins ( see Dawkins Revolution ) . Under the original HECS , a $1,800 fee was charged to all university students , and the Commonwealth paid the balance . A student could defer payment of this HECS amount ( in which case it was called a HECS debt ) and repay the debt through the tax system , when the student 's income exceeds a threshold level . As part of the reforms , Colleges of Advanced Education entered the University sector by various means . The HECS system was accepted by both federal political parties and has survived until today , though with a number of changes .

This system was implemented during the government of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam in **1974**, making university education accessible to citizens from all socioeconomic backgrounds.\n\nHowever, by the 1980s, the rising costs of tertiary education, increased demand for university places, and government budget pressures prompted a re-evaluation of how higher education was funded. The Labor government under Bob Hawke introduced HECS as a way to share the cost of education between students and taxpayers while still encouraging participation in higher education.\n\n### What HECS Did:\nHECS made university education partially funded by students, but it was designed to remain accessible:\n1. Students were required to pay a contribution towards the cost of their education, but it wasn't due upfront. Instead, payments could be deferred and repaid through the tax system once their income exceeded a certain threshold.\n2. This system was seen as a compromise, balancing the need for government funding with individual contributions based on income.\n\n### Subsequent Changes:\nThe HECS system has undergone numerous changes since its introduction. Over time:\n- The amount students are required to pay has increased.\n- The system has been renamed and restructured into the **HECS-HELP** scheme.\n- Income thresholds for repayment and interest calculations have been adjusted several times.\n  \nWhile HECS made higher education no longer \"free,\" the Australian system is still considered relatively accessible compared to many other countries due to its deferred payment structure.\n\n### Significance:\nThe introduction of HECS in 1989 marked a significant policy shift in Australia's higher education system. It reflected broader economic and social changes occurring globally during the late 20th century, including a push for greater cost-sharing in public services.","em":0,"f1":0.2222222222}
{"question":"do you cut cards to the left or right","short_answers":["right"],"long_answer":" A common procedure is that after the cards have been shuffled , the dealer sets the cards face - down on the table near the player designated to make the cut , typically the player to the dealer 's right .

Once the cut is complete , the dealer picks up the deck , straightens or `` squares '' it , and deals the cards . ","category":"Undetermined lexicons or references","judgment":"underspecified","reasoning":"The request is underspecified because the phrase \"cut cards\" can refer to multiple parallel practices across different card games, and the direction (left or right) depends on the specific game's rules or conventions. Without specifying the game or context, the referent remains ambiguous.","model_short_answer":["To the left."],"model_long_answer":"When cutting a deck of cards, whether you cut to the left or the right depends on the context, the rules of the game you're playing, and personal or cultural preferences. There isn't a universally \"correct\" way to cut cards because the direction of the cut doesn't fundamentally change the process. However, here\u2019s a breakdown to clarify:\n\n### General Card Cutting Practice:\n1. **Standard Cutting**: \n   - Typically, the deck is placed on a table or held in one hand.\n   - The cutter (another player or yourself, depending on the situation) uses one hand to lift a portion of the deck off the top and places it to one side, either to the left or the right, depending on preference.\n   - The remaining portion of the deck is then placed on top of the cut portion to complete the cut.\n\n2. **Direction of the Cut**:\n   - **To the Left**: In some games, players traditionally cut cards to the left. This might stem from right-handed players finding it more natural to move cards to the left, as their dominant hand controls the deck while the opposite hand moves the cut portion.\n   - **To the Right**: Other settings or cultural practices might favor moving the cut stack to the right. For example, in some gambling games or formal settings, the dealer might specify the direction for consistency.\n\n### Cultural or Game-Specific Rules:\n- **Casino Rules**: \n  In most casinos, the player who cuts the deck is instructed to simply lift a portion of the deck and place it to one side, without specifying a direction. The dealer or house rules dictate the exact procedure, and the deck is often cut to ensure fairness.\n  \n- **Card Games**: \n  In casual card games, there is usually no strict rule about cutting direction unless specified. The primary goal is simply to shuffle or randomize the order of the deck further.\n\n### Superstitions or Traditions:\nSome card players or magicians may have personal rituals or superstitions about cutting cards. For example:\n- Cutting with the left hand or to the left might be seen as \"luckier\" in some cultures or traditions.\n- In other contexts, cutting to the right might be considered more natural or appropriate.\n\n### Practical Tips:\n- Confirm with other players or the dealer if a specific method is required for the game you're playing.\n- If no specific direction is mentioned, choose the one that feels most comfortable to you.\n\n### Fun Fact:\nThe act of cutting cards has its roots in ensuring fairness and preventing cheating. Historically, having someone other than the dealer cut the cards acted as a way to prevent the dealer from stacking the deck in their favor. Today, it remains a standard practice in games and card tricks to add an extra layer of randomness.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

Georgia is portrayed by actress Georgia Groome in the movie. The film and book series are beloved for their humorous, relatable portrayal of teenage life, including the trials of navigating friendships, crushes, and embarrassing family moments.\n\n### Who is Georgia Nicolson?\n\nGeorgia is a quirky, dramatic, and self-conscious 14-year-old girl living in Eastbourne, England. She is known for her witty narration and over-the-top internal monologues, which give the audience a hilarious glimpse into her thoughts. Georgia is navigating the ups and downs of adolescence, including her relationships with her eccentric family, her best friends (known as the \"Ace Gang\"), and her romantic interest, Robbie Jennings, the \"Sex God.\"\n\nHer character is a mix of confidence, insecurity, and awkwardness, which makes her highly relatable to teenage audiences. Georgia often obsesses over fitting in, looking attractive, and winning the attention of Robbie, all while dealing with embarrassing situations, such as her dad working abroad, her nosy little sister Libby, and her wild pet cat, Angus.\n\n### Georgia\u2019s Romantic Journey\n\nA major plotline in both the film and the book revolves around Georgia\u2019s crush on Robbie, who is in a band and is dating Lindsay, a popular but mean girl. Georgia is determined to win Robbie's affections and even goes to hilarious lengths to make him notice her, such as trying to change her appearance (she disastrously attempts to dye her eyebrows) and attempting to learn how to kiss properly (hence the \"perfect snogging\" in the title).\n\nWhat makes Georgia compelling is her growth throughout the story. While she starts off shallow and focused solely on impressing Robbie, she eventually learns valuable lessons about self-acceptance, loyalty to her friends, and being true to herself.\n\n### Georgia's Family and Friends\n\n- **Angus:** Georgia's enormous and mischievous pet cat, who often steals the spotlight with his antics.\n- **Libby:** Georgia\u2019s younger sister, who is adorably weird and often causes chaos in Georgia\u2019s life.\n- **Jas:** Georgia's best friend and fellow member of the Ace Gang. Georgia and Jas have their ups and downs but ultimately share a strong bond.\n- **The Ace Gang:** Georgia\u2019s close-knit group of girlfriends who help her navigate the ups and downs of being a teenager.\n\n### Film vs. Books\n\nThe film *\"Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging\"* combines elements from the first two books in Rennison\u2019s series: *\"Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging\"* and *\"It\u2019s OK, I\u2019m Wearing Really Big Knickers.\"* While the movie condenses some of the plot points and characters, it captures the spirit of Georgia\u2019s humor and the chaotic energy of her life.\n\n### Legacy\n\nGeorgia Nicolson remains a beloved character for many fans who grew up reading the books or watching the movie. Her story resonates with teens because it humorously tackles the awkwardness of growing up, first love, and finding confidence in who you are. The series is often praised for its hilarity, relatability, and authentic depiction of teenage life.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in Georgia\u2019s adventures, you might enjoy diving into the full *Confessions of Georgia Nicolson* book series, which spans ten books and delves even deeper into her life and relationships.","em":0,"f1":0.5}

This significant battle occurred on **October 3\u20134, 1862**, and was fought between Union and Confederate forces. Corinth was strategically important during the war because it was a critical transportation hub, located at the junction of two major railroad lines: the **Mobile and Ohio Railroad** (running north-south) and the **Memphis and Charleston Railroad** (running east-west). These railroads were vital for moving troops and supplies, making control of Corinth a high priority for both sides.\n\n### Historical Context\nAfter the Union victory at the nearby **Battle of Shiloh** in April 1862, Union forces, led by Major General **Henry W.

However, the Confederacy still sought to reclaim this vital location.\n\nThe October battle was a Confederate attempt to retake Corinth. Confederate forces, under the command of Major General **Earl Van Dorn** and Major General **Sterling Price**, launched an offensive against the Union garrison stationed there, which was commanded by Major General **William S. Rosecrans**. Despite initial successes on the first day of the battle, the Confederate assault was repelled on the second day, and they were forced to retreat.\n\n### Aftermath\nThe Union victory at Corinth solidified Northern control over the region and further weakened the Confederate position in the Western Theater. The battle also highlighted the importance of Corinth's railroads and demonstrated the Union's growing ability to maintain strategic strongholds in the South.\n\nToday, the site of the battle is preserved as part of the **Corinth Civil War Interpretive Center**, which is managed by the National Park Service as part of the **Shiloh National Military Park**.

Its primary function is to ensure that the public service operates efficiently, fairly, and with integrity. While the specific duties and responsibilities of a civil service commission can vary depending on the country or jurisdiction, the general role of such commissions is to establish and enforce rules and regulations governing the recruitment, promotion, discipline, and overall management of civil servants.\n\nBelow is an overview of the typical roles and responsibilities of a civil service commission:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Recruitment and Hiring**\n   - The civil service commission is often responsible for ensuring that recruitment into the civil service is merit-based, free from political interference, and equitable.\n   - It oversees the development of standardized exams, interviews, and selection procedures to evaluate candidates\u2019 qualifications and competencies.\n   - The goal is to attract the best talent to public service positions through a transparent and competitive process.\n\n### 2. **Promotions and Career Advancement**\n   - The commission ensures that promotions within the civil service are based on merit, seniority, or other established criteria.\n   - It develops and enforces policies that ensure fair opportunities for career progression for all civil servants.\n\n### 3. **Disciplinary Actions and Accountability**\n   - It handles complaints, investigations, and disciplinary actions involving civil servants who violate rules or fail to perform their duties.\n   - The commission ensures that disciplinary measures are fair, impartial, and consistent with established regulations.\n\n### 4. **Protection of Civil Servants**\n   - The CSC protects civil servants from political interference or wrongful termination, ensuring job security for employees who perform their roles in accordance with the law.\n   - It often serves as a neutral arbiter in disputes between civil servants and their employers.\n\n### 5. **Policy Development and Enforcement**\n   - The civil service commission plays a role in establishing and updating policies and regulations that govern the conduct, ethics, and performance of public employees.\n   - These policies may include codes of conduct, anti-corruption measures, and performance evaluation systems.\n\n### 6. **Training and Professional Development**\n   - Many civil service commissions are responsible for organizing or overseeing training programs to develop the skills and competencies of public employees.\n   - Continuous professional development ensures that civil servants can adapt to changing demands and deliver better services to the public.\n\n### 7. **Ensuring Inclusivity and Equal Opportunities**\n   - Civil service commissions often work to promote diversity and inclusion within the public service.\n   - They may implement affirmative action or equal opportunity policies to ensure that underrepresented groups have a fair chance to join and succeed in the civil service.\n\n### 8. **Promoting Ethics and Integrity**\n   - The commission ensures that civil servants adhere to high ethical standards by implementing codes of conduct and monitoring for corruption or unethical behavior.\n   - It may also educate civil servants about their rights and responsibilities.\n\n### 9. **Advisory Function**\n   - In some jurisdictions, civil service commissions advise the government or other branches of the public sector on matters related to human resource management, public service reforms, or civil service laws.\n\n### 10. **Appeals and Grievances**\n   - The CSC serves as an appellate body for civil servants who wish to challenge decisions related to hiring, promotions, disciplinary actions, or other employment matters.\n   - This ensures an impartial review of disputes and helps maintain trust in the system.\n\n---\n\n### Examples of Civil Service Commissions Around the World\n\n1. **United States**: \n   - The U.S. Civil Service Commission was established in 1883 by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act. Its primary goal was to eliminate the \"spoils system\" and implement merit-based hiring. In 1978, it was replaced by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), which now carry out many of the same functions.\n\n2. **Philippines**:\n   - The Civil Service Commission is a constitutional body responsible for overseeing the integrity and efficiency of the public service. It ensures that government employees are hired based on merit and fitness and promotes accountability and professionalism within the public sector.\n\n3. **United Kingdom**:\n   - The UK Civil Service Commission regulates recruitment to the Civil Service, ensuring appointments are made on merit through fair and open competition. It also hears complaints under the Civil Service Code.\n\n4. **Nigeria**:\n   - The Federal Civil Service Commission in Nigeria is responsible for appointing, promoting, and disciplining civil servants, ensuring that employment practices are fair and based on merit.\n\n---\n\n### Importance of the Civil Service Commission\nThe civil service commission is vital for maintaining a professional, non-partisan, and efficient public service. By ensuring that civil servants are selected, promoted, and disciplined fairly, the commission helps build public trust in government institutions. It also fosters a productive and motivated public workforce, which is essential for effective governance and service delivery.","em":0,"f1":0.3636363636}

The Ashvamedha sacrifice was a ritual performed by kings, but the concept of \"coins issued after the sacrifice\" is unclear. The referent \"ashwamedha coins\" lacks a clear definition, and the question does not specify which kingdom or time period is being referenced, leaving the answer ambiguous.","model_short_answer":["Gupta rulers, such as Samudragupta and Kumaragupta I"],"model_long_answer":"The **Ashvamedha sacrifice** (or horse sacrifice) was an ancient Vedic ritual performed by powerful monarchs to assert their sovereignty and authority over their realms. After conducting the Ashvamedha, coins were often issued by rulers to commemorate the event, symbolizing their imperial power and the successful completion of the ritual.\n\nOne of the most notable examples of issuing Ashvamedha coins comes from **Gupta Emperor Samudragupta**, a ruler of the Gupta Empire in ancient India, who reigned from approximately 335\u2013375 CE. Samudragupta is renowned for his military conquests, cultural patronage, and the performance of the Ashvamedha sacrifice to proclaim his supreme authority over vast territories.\n\n### Samudragupta's Ashvamedha Coins:\n- After performing the Ashvamedha, Samudragupta issued gold coins known as **Ashvamedha coins** to commemorate the event. These coins are some of the finest examples of Gupta numismatics and provide insight into the political and cultural milieu of the time.\n- The coins typically depicted a horse (symbolizing the Ashvamedha ritual) on one side and a sacrificial altar or figure performing the sacrifice on the reverse.\n- The inscriptions on the coins glorify Samudragupta as a universal ruler and emphasize his legitimacy as a sovereign emperor.\n\n### Symbolism of Ashvamedha Coins:\n- The coins served as a declaration of the ruler's authority and divine sanction to rule.\n- They were a means to propagate the success of the sacrifice and legitimize the ruler's dominance over rival kings and conquered territories.\n- The Ashvamedha ritual itself involved a consecrated horse being allowed to wander freely through territories, and if rival kings did not challenge the horse, it symbolized their submission to the ruler performing the sacrifice.\n\n### Other Rulers and Ashvamedha Coins:\nWhile Samudragupta is the most famous example, other rulers in ancient and medieval India also performed the Ashvamedha and issued commemorative coins. For instance:\n- **Pushyamitra Shunga**, the founder of the Shunga dynasty (2nd century BCE), is believed to have performed the Ashvamedha sacrifice, though no coins directly associated with it are attributed to him.\n- In later periods, rulers of smaller kingdoms might also have issued coins after performing the ritual, but none are as prominent as Samudragupta's examples.\n\nIn summary, **Samudragupta** is the most well-documented ruler who issued **Ashvamedha coins**, and these coins are celebrated as masterpieces of Gupta coinage, reflecting the power and grandeur of his reign.","em":0,"f1":0.2222222222}

The top of the seamount is about 975 m ( 3,000 ft ) below sea level . This seamount is on the flank of Mauna Loa , the largest shield volcano on Earth . L\u014dihi , meaning `` long '' in Hawaiian , is the newest volcano in the Hawaiian - Emperor seamount chain , a string of volcanoes that stretches over 5,800 km ( 3,600 mi ) northwest of L\u014d\u02bbihi . Unlike most active volcanoes in the Pacific Ocean that make up the active plate margins on the Pacific Ring of Fire , L\u014d\u02bbihi and the other volcanoes of the Hawaiian - Emperor seamount chain are hotspot volcanoes and formed well away from the nearest plate boundary . Volcanoes in the Hawaiian Islands arise from the Hawaii hotspot , and as the youngest volcano in the chain , L\u014dihi is the only Hawaiian volcano in the deep submarine preshield stage of development . ","category":"Undetermined lexicons or references","judgment":"underspecified","reasoning":"The request is underspecified because the term \"Loihi\" can refer to multiple parallel entities, such as the underwater volcano Loihi in the Hawaiian Islands or a person\/organization with the same name. Without clarifying the specific referent, the origin or context remains ambiguous.","model_short_answer":["- \"Loihi\" refers to L\u014d\u02bbihi Seamount, an underwater volcano.\n- It originates from the seafloor southeast of the Big Island of Hawaii."],"model_long_answer":"**L\u014d\u2018ihi** refers to **L\u014d\u2018ihi Seamount**, an active underwater volcano (or submarine volcano) located about 35 kilometers (22 miles) southeast of the Big Island of Hawaii. It is part of the Hawaiian\u2013Emperor seamount chain, a series of volcanic islands, atolls, and seamounts created by the movement of the Pacific tectonic plate over a volcanic hotspot in the Earth's mantle.\n\n### Origin and Formation:\nL\u014d\u2018ihi is formed due to the **Hawaiian hotspot**, a stationary plume of hot magma rising from deep within the Earth's mantle. The Pacific Plate moves over this hotspot at a rate of roughly 7\u201310 centimeters (2.8\u20133.9 inches) per year in a northwesterly direction. As the plate shifts, new volcanoes emerge, creating the chain of islands and underwater features. L\u014d\u2018ihi is the **youngest volcano** in this chain and is considered a **\"pre-shield stage\"** volcano, meaning it is in the earliest phase of its development.\n\nCurrently, L\u014d\u2018ihi's summit is about 975 meters (3,200 feet) below sea level. It is expected to eventually grow taller and emerge above the ocean surface, forming a new volcanic island in tens of thousands of years. When it does, it will likely become the next addition to the Hawaiian Islands.\n\n### Geological Features:\n- L\u014d\u2018ihi has a summit area with three craters (Pele's Pit being the most prominent) and extends into rift zones to the northeast and south.\n- It is geologically active, with eruptions and earthquake swarms recorded in modern times. For example, in 1996, a significant earthquake swarm occurred that caused parts of the summit to collapse and form Pele's Pit.\n- L\u014d\u2018ihi erupts primarily basaltic lava, similar to the other volcanoes in Hawaii, and this lava builds up the seamount over time.\n\n### Significance:\n- L\u014d\u2018ihi provides important insights into the early stages of volcano formation and the dynamics of the Hawaiian hotspot.\n- It is also a site of scientific interest for its hydrothermal vents, which support unique ecosystems of extremophiles (organisms that thrive in extreme environments).\n\nIn summary, L\u014d\u2018ihi is an underwater volcano that originates from the Hawaiian hotspot and represents the youngest stage of volcanic development in the Hawaiian\u2013Emperor seamount chain. Over geological time, it is expected to rise above the ocean, continuing the legacy of island formation in Hawaii.","em":0,"f1":0.375}

To better understand the origins of \"Marilyn,\" let's break it down:\n\n1. **Mary**: The first part of the name, \"Mary,\" has deep historical and biblical roots. It is derived from the Hebrew name **Miryam** (or Miriam), which is thought to mean \"beloved,\" \"bitter,\" or \"rebellious.\" Mary is one of the most important names in Christian tradition, as it is associated with the Virgin Mary, the mother of Jesus. Because of this, it became one of the most enduring and popular names in Western cultures.\n\n2. **Lynn**: The second part, \"Lynn,\" is of Old English and Welsh origin, and it means \"lake,\" \"waterfall,\" or \"pool.\" It was traditionally used as a surname or a given name, often associated with nature.\n\n3. **Combination**: \"Marilyn\" emerged as a modern invention by blending these two names. Its earliest recorded use seems to be in the late 19th or early 20th century, and it became more widespread in the 1920s and 1930s. The name likely gained additional popularity due to its melodic sound and the trend of creating new, stylish names during that era.\n\n4. **Cultural Popularity**: The name \"Marilyn\" reached iconic status largely due to the legendary American actress and cultural icon **Marilyn Monroe** (1926\u20131962). Born as Norma Jeane Mortenson, Monroe adopted \"Marilyn\" as her stage name when she began her career in Hollywood in the 1940s. Her fame and legacy made the name synonymous with glamour, beauty, and charisma, leading to a surge in its popularity during the mid-20th century.\n\nIn summary, the name \"Marilyn\" is a relatively modern creation that combines traditional elements from \"Mary\" and \"Lynn.\" Its association with Marilyn Monroe played a significant role in cementing its place in popular culture. Today, it remains a classic, albeit less common, name.","em":0,"f1":0.0714285714}

The referent \"troops\" is ambiguous in this context, as the Security Council itself does not deploy troops directly.","model_short_answer":["From member states volunteering troops."],"model_long_answer":"The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) does not maintain its own standing military force. Instead, it relies on contributions from its member states to provide troops, police, and support personnel for peacekeeping and military operations. This system is part of the broader framework of United Nations peacekeeping and is governed by international agreements and resolutions passed by the UNSC.\n\n### Process of Obtaining Troops for Military Actions:\n1. **Mandate from the Security Council**: \n   - The process begins with the UNSC passing a resolution that authorizes a military or peacekeeping operation. This resolution outlines the mission's objectives, scope, and rules of engagement.\n   - The resolution may be in response to conflicts, civil wars, humanitarian crises, or threats to international peace and security.\n\n2. **Request for Contributions from Member States**:\n   - After authorizing a mission, the UN Secretariat (specifically the Department of Peace Operations) requests member states to contribute troops, police, equipment, and financial support.\n   - Participation is voluntary, and countries decide whether to contribute based on their own foreign policy, military capacity, and willingness.\n\n3. **Formation of Multinational Forces**:\n   - Member states contribute troops and resources to form a multinational force. These forces operate under the blue helmets of the UN, signifying their peacekeeping role.\n   - The military personnel remain under their own national command, but they operate within the framework and authority of the UN mission.\n\n4. **Command Structure**:\n   - While the troops are contributed by various member states, the UN establishes a unified command structure for the operation. The mission is led by a Force Commander, typically a senior military officer appointed by the UN Secretary-General.\n\n5. **Types of Contributions**:\n   - **Troop-Contributing Countries (TCCs)**: Nations that provide soldiers for peacekeeping missions.\n   - **Police-Contributing Countries (PCCs)**: Nations that provide police officers for law enforcement and stability operations.\n   - Nations also provide logistical support, equipment, and funding.\n\n### Countries Contributing Troops:\n- The countries that contribute the most troops often include developing nations, as participation in UN missions can bring financial reimbursement from the UN and international recognition.\n- As of recent years, countries such as Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Nepal have been among the largest contributors of troops and police to UN peacekeeping missions.\n- Wealthier nations often contribute funding, logistics, and specialized personnel rather than large numbers of troops.\n\n### Challenges in Troop Contributions:\n- **Delays in Deployment**: It can take weeks or months to assemble and deploy forces after a resolution is passed.\n- **Diverse Standards and Training**: Troops from different countries may have varying levels of training and equipment, which can complicate coordination.\n- **Political Will**: Some countries may be reluctant to commit troops to certain missions due to political, strategic, or security concerns.\n- **Reimbursement Incentives**: The UN reimburses countries for their contributions, but delays in payments can discourage participation.\n\n### Historical Examples of UNSC-Authorized Military Actions:\n1. **Korean War (1950-1953)**:\n   - The UNSC authorized a military response to North Korea's invasion of South Korea. A multinational force, led by the United States, was assembled under the UN flag.\n   \n2. **Gulf War (1990-1991)**:\n   - The UNSC authorized a coalition force to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait after Iraq's invasion. This operation was led by the United States and supported by numerous countries.\n\n3. **Peacekeeping Missions**:\n   - The UN has deployed peacekeepers to conflict zones such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO), South Sudan (UNMISS), and Mali (MINUSMA).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe UNSC depends on the voluntary cooperation of its member states to provide troops for military actions and peacekeeping missions. The contributions are coordinated by the UN, and the operations are carried out under the authority of the UNSC. This collaborative system reflects the international nature of the UN but also poses challenges in terms of coordination, funding, and political will.","em":0,"f1":0.3333333333}

The team that kicks the ball first is determined by a coin toss conducted by the referee before the match begins.\n\n### How the Process Works:\n\n1. **Coin Toss**: Before the game, the referee and the two team captains meet in the center circle. A coin is tossed to determine which team gets to choose between:\n   - Kicking off to start the match, or\n   - Choosing which side of the field to defend in the first half.\n\n2. **First Kickoff**: The team that wins the coin toss often chooses which side of the field to defend. The other team, by default, gets to take the first kickoff to start the game.\n\n3. **Positioning**:\n   - The ball is placed on the center spot in the middle of the field.\n   - At least two players from the kicking team must be in the center circle, and the ball must be stationary before it is kicked.\n   - All opposing players must remain outside the center circle until the ball is kicked and moves.\n\n4. **The Kick**:\n   - The ball is in play as soon as it is kicked and moves clearly (it doesn't need to travel forward, as per recent changes to the laws of the game by the International Football Association Board (IFAB)).\n   - The player who takes the kickoff cannot touch the ball again until another player has touched it.\n\n5. **Second Half Kickoff**: In the second half, the teams switch sides, and the team that did not take the first kickoff gets to start with the ball.\n\n### Additional Context:\n- In extra time (if played), a new coin toss is conducted to determine which team kicks off and which side they will defend.\n- If a goal is scored during the game, the team that conceded the goal takes the kickoff to restart the match.\n\nThis system ensures fairness and alternates opportunities for both teams to begin play. The kickoff is a symbolic moment that officially starts the match and sets the pace for the game.","em":0,"f1":0.4444444444}

Without clarifying the specific context, time period, or theoretical framework, the question lacks a precise referent or standard for answering.","model_short_answer":["Ancient Greece, particularly Athens."],"model_long_answer":"The idea of democracy, as a system of government where power is vested in the people, has its origins in ancient civilizations, particularly in ancient Greece. The concept evolved over centuries, influenced by various cultures, thinkers, and political systems. Below is an overview of where the idea of democracy came from and how it developed.\n\n---\n\n### **Ancient Greece: The Birthplace of Democracy**\nThe word \"democracy\" itself comes from the Greek words *demos* (meaning \"people\") and *kratos* (meaning \"power\" or \"rule\"), translating to \"rule by the people.\" The earliest and most famous example of democracy originated in Athens, a city-state in ancient Greece, during the 5th century BCE.\n\n1. **Athenian Democracy**:\n   - Athens established a form of direct democracy around 508\u2013507 BCE under the leadership of Cleisthenes, often called the \"Father of Athenian Democracy.\"\n   - In this system, citizens (free adult males who were Athenian-born) could participate directly in decision-making. They gathered in assemblies where they voted on laws, policies, and other important matters.\n   - Other democratic institutions included the *Boule* (a council of 500 citizens chosen by lot) and the *Heliaia* (a people's court), which ensured broader participation in governance.\n\n   However, Athenian democracy had limitations:\n   - Women, slaves, and non-citizens were excluded from political participation.\n   - It was a direct democracy, meaning citizens participated in decision-making rather than electing representatives, which is distinct from most modern democracies.\n\n2. **Underlying Philosophical Ideas**:\n   - Philosophers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle discussed forms of governance, including democracy. While Socrates valued questioning authority, Plato criticized democracy for its potential to devolve into mob rule. Aristotle, however, saw democracy as one of the potential \"correct\" forms of government but warned against its degeneration into ochlocracy (rule by the mob).\n\n---\n\n### **Other Early Influences on Democratic Ideas**\nWhile Greece is often credited with inventing democracy, early democratic principles and practices can also be traced to other cultures and civilizations:\n\n1. **Mesopotamia**: \n   - Some ancient Mesopotamian city-states, such as in Sumer, had assemblies where citizens could voice their opinions and make decisions, though the king or a ruling elite often held the ultimate authority.\n\n2. **India**:\n   - In ancient India, certain republics or \"ganas\" (assemblies) operated with collective decision-making. These were particularly prevalent in the Vedic period (circa 1500\u2013500 BCE), where clans and tribal assemblies allowed for some forms of participatory governance.\n\n3. **Rome**:\n   - The Roman Republic (509\u201327 BCE) also contributed to the development of democratic ideas. While not a democracy in the modern sense, it had institutions like the Senate and popular assemblies that allowed citizens (though largely limited to patricians and later plebeians) to participate in governance.\n   - The Roman Republic introduced the concept of representative governance, which would later influence the development of modern democracies.\n\n---\n\n### **Medieval and Early Modern Contributions**\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire, democratic practices largely disappeared in Europe during the Middle Ages, as feudal systems dominated. However, seeds of democratic thought survived and began to flourish again in the early modern period.\n\n1. **Magna Carta (1215)**:\n   - In England, the signing of the Magna Carta by King John marked an important step in limiting the power of the monarchy and establishing certain rights for nobles. Over time, these ideas evolved to promote broader participation in governance.\n\n2. **Renaissance and Enlightenment Thinkers**:\n   - The Renaissance (14th\u201317th centuries) revived interest in classical ideas, including democracy.\n   - Enlightenment philosophers, such as John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Montesquieu, and Voltaire, developed ideas about individual rights, the social contract, and the separation of powers, all of which became foundational to modern democratic theory.\n\n3. **Early Parliamentary Systems**:\n   - In England, the development of Parliament as a representative institution laid the groundwork for constitutional democracies. By the 17th century, the English Civil War and the Glorious Revolution helped establish parliamentary sovereignty and curtailed monarchical power.\n\n---\n\n### **Modern Democracy**\nThe modern concept of democracy has been shaped by centuries of struggle for rights, representation, and equality. Key milestones include:\n\n1. **The American Revolution (1775\u20131783)**:\n   - The United States established one of the first modern representative democracies, influenced by Enlightenment ideas and classical republicanism.\n   - The U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights enshrined principles of popular sovereignty, checks and balances, and individual freedoms.\n\n2. **The French Revolution (1789\u20131799)**:\n   - The French Revolution further advanced democratic ideals, emphasizing liberty, equality, and fraternity. It also pushed for the abolition of monarchy and aristocratic privilege.\n\n3. **19th and 20th Century Expansions**:\n   - Over time, suffrage expanded to include broader segments of the population, including women, people of color, and lower-income groups.\n   - The spread of democracy was also influenced by decolonization, the civil rights movement, and the fall of authoritarian regimes in the 20th century.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe idea of democracy has deep historical roots, evolving from ancient Greek city-states to modern representative democracies. It has been shaped by a variety of cultural, philosophical, and political influences across different civilizations. While ancient Athens provided the first organized model of democracy, the principles of participation, equality, and accountability have been refined and expanded over centuries to create the diverse forms of democracy we see today.","em":0,"f1":0.4}

These early landmasses eventually coalesced into larger supercontinents over time.\n\nOne of the earliest known supercontinents in Earth's history is **Vaalbara**, which is considered by scientists to be the first supercontinent. Vaalbara is thought to have formed around **3.6 to 3.1 billion years ago** during the Archean Eon. It was made up of proto-continental crust that eventually broke apart over millions of years due to tectonic activity.\n\n### Key Points About Vaalbara:\n1. **Name Origin**: The name \"Vaalbara\" comes from two ancient cratons (stable cores of continents) that provide evidence of its existence\u2014**the Kaapvaal Craton** in South Africa and the **Pilbara Craton** in Western Australia.\n2. **Evidence**: Geological evidence supporting Vaalbara includes similarities in rock formations, ages, and geochemical data from these cratons.\n3. **Fragmentation**: Vaalbara eventually split apart due to plate tectonic movements, leading to the formation of other landmasses and supercontinents over time.\n\nAfter Vaalbara, other early supercontinents formed, such as **Ur** (around 3 billion years ago), **Kenorland** (around 2.7 billion years ago), and **Columbia\/Nuna** (around 1.8 billion years ago).

The term \"country folk\" is vague without specifying a cultural, historical, or literary source, and the connection to \"archers\" is ambiguous without additional context. The slogan\u2019s purpose, origin, or specific reference is unclear, making the question open-ended.","model_short_answer":["'The Yeoman's Weapon'"],"model_long_answer":"The origin of the country folk slogan used to describe archers is often associated with the phrase \u201cGod save the King, but keep your longbows strong,\u201d which was a sentiment expressed in medieval England to praise the skill and importance of archers in warfare. However, a more famous slogan or phrase tied to English archers comes from the folklore surrounding the Battle of Agincourt (1415), during the Hundred Years\u2019 War between England and France.\n\nAt the Battle of Agincourt, English longbowmen played a decisive role in defeating the French army. The longbow was a weapon of choice for English archers, especially those from rural areas or the \"country folk,\" as it required skill, strength, and years of practice\u2014traits often associated with commoners rather than knights or nobility.\n\nOne notable story or slogan tied to these archers is the idea of the \"two-finger salute.\" According to legend, during the war, French forces threatened to cut off the index and middle fingers of captured English archers to prevent them from using their longbows again. In response, English longbowmen supposedly taunted the French by raising their two fingers in defiance, showing they still had their fingers and could fight. This gesture is said to have evolved into the modern-day \"V-sign\" or a rude gesture in British culture.\n\nWhile this story is popular and often repeated, historians debate its historical accuracy. There is no strong evidence to confirm the practice of cutting off fingers as a widespread punishment, nor is there proof that the two-finger salute originated from this context. Still, the tale has become part of English folklore and serves as an example of how country folk\u2014often the backbone of the English army\u2014took great pride in their skill and resilience as archers.\n\nThe longbow, in particular, became a symbol of English strength and rural ingenuity. Archers were typically drawn from the working class, including farmers and laborers, who practiced archery as a sport and a necessity for hunting. The slogan \"Keep your longbows strong\" or similar phrases reflect the reliance on these rural men to defend their nation. Their skill helped secure victories in battles like Agincourt, where the English army, though outnumbered, used their longbows to devastating effect against the heavily armored French knights.\n\nIn summary, the story of country folk and their association with archery is deeply rooted in English history and folklore, with slogans and tales celebrating their role in shaping military success and national identity.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

Without specifying which type of rhythm is intended, the question remains underspecified.","model_short_answer":["Merengue"],"model_long_answer":"The emblematic rhythm of the Dominican Republic is **merengue**, a lively and fast-paced musical and dance genre that holds a central place in the country\u2019s culture and identity. Merengue is not only considered the national music of the Dominican Republic but also a key symbol of Dominican pride and heritage. It was declared an **Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity** by UNESCO in 2016, underscoring its importance to the cultural fabric of the nation.\n\n### Origins and Characteristics of Merengue\nMerengue originated in the Dominican Republic in the early 19th century, though its exact origins are debated. It is believed to have evolved from a mix of African, European, and indigenous influences, reflecting the diverse cultural history of the island of Hispaniola (which the Dominican Republic shares with Haiti). Merengue became widely popular in the mid-20th century, particularly during the regime of dictator Rafael Trujillo (1930-1961), who promoted it as a symbol of national unity.\n\nThe music is characterized by its **fast tempo**, **catchy melodies**, and **syncopated rhythms**. Traditional merengue ensembles typically feature instruments such as:\n- **Accordion**: A key melodic instrument, reflecting its European influence.\n- **Tambora**: A double-headed drum with African roots, providing the rhythm.\n- **Guira**: A metal scraper played with a stick, contributing a distinctive percussive sound.\n\nThe dance associated with merengue is equally iconic. It involves partners dancing closely together in a side-to-side motion, often with quick and intricate footwork, making it both intimate and energetic.\n\n### Merengue's Cultural Significance\nMerengue is more than just music or dance; it is a unifying force in the Dominican Republic, transcending social and economic boundaries. It is played at virtually every celebration, from weddings and birthdays to national holidays. The genre has also achieved international success, with artists like **Juan Luis Guerra** bringing merengue to global audiences. Juan Luis Guerra, in particular, is renowned for blending traditional merengue with modern elements, incorporating poetic lyrics and themes of love, social justice, and Dominican identity.\n\n### Other Rhythms in the Dominican Republic\nWhile merengue is the most emblematic rhythm, the Dominican Republic is also famous for **bachata**, another deeply cherished genre. Bachata originated in the rural areas as a romantic and melancholic music style, but over time it has gained immense popularity worldwide, with artists like **Romeo Santos** and **Aventura** propelling it into the mainstream.\n\nIn conclusion, merengue remains the heartbeat of the Dominican Republic, representing the vibrancy, resilience, and joy of its people. It is a genre that has stood the test of time, continuing to evolve while staying deeply rooted in the Dominican cultural identity.","em":1,"f1":1.0}

","category":"Undetermined lexicons or references","judgment":"underspecified","reasoning":"The request is underspecified because the term \"prime minister\" is used in multiple countries with different historical contexts. Without specifying which country or political system is being referenced, the answer depends on the specific historical usage, making the question ambiguous.","model_short_answer":["The term 'prime minister' was first used in the 17th century in England."],"model_long_answer":"The term \"prime minister\" was first used in the early 17th century, but it did not initially refer to an official political title or position. Instead, it was used informally to describe the leader or head of a government, often the monarch's chief minister. The title gradually evolved into an official and widely recognized designation over time.\n\n### Early Usage\nThe earliest known use of the term \"prime minister\" in English dates back to the 17th century. For example, in 1624, Cardinal Richelieu of France was referred to as the \"Premier Ministre\" (French for \"prime minister\"), though this was not an official title. The term was used to describe someone who acted as the king's principal advisor or minister, often wielding significant political power.\n\nIn Britain, the term \"prime minister\" came into informal use during the 18th century, particularly in reference to Sir Robert Walpole, who is often regarded as the first de facto prime minister of Great Britain. Walpole served as the head of the government from 1721 to 1742 and was the most powerful figure in the British political system at the time. However, he never officially held the title of \"prime minister.\" Instead, he held the formal title of \"First Lord of the Treasury.\"\n\n### Formalization of the Term\nThe term \"prime minister\" was initially used as a term of criticism, implying that the individual had amassed too much power or influence. Over time, however, it became more widely accepted as the role of the head of government became distinct from that of the monarch. By the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the title \"prime minister\" had become a common and accepted way to describe the leader of a government in parliamentary systems, though it was not officially codified in Britain until much later.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the title was only formally recognized in law in the 20th century. For example, the \"Chequers Estate Act\" of 1917 referred to the prime minister explicitly, and the term was officially used in documents such as the \"Ministerial and other Salaries Act\" of 1937.\n\n### Global Usage\nThe role and title of \"prime minister\" spread around the world during the 19th and 20th centuries, particularly in countries influenced by the British parliamentary system or colonial administration. Today, the prime minister is the head of government in many countries, including Canada, Australia, India, and Japan, among others.\n\nIn summary, while the term \"prime minister\" was first used informally in the 17th century, it gradually evolved into an official title over the following centuries, with Sir Robert Walpole often considered the first de facto prime minister in Britain. Its usage has since spread globally as part of parliamentary systems of government.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

This marked the first time that a flat-rate cash payment was made to families for their children, replacing earlier systems of family allowances and tax relief for children. \n\nInitially, child benefit was paid at a weekly rate of **\u00a31 for the first child** and **\u00a31.50 for subsequent children**. Later, the benefit was equalized so that payments for all children, including the firstborn, were the same.\n\n### Historical Context\nBefore child benefit, the UK had a system called **family allowances**, which dated back to 1946. Family allowances only provided payments for the second and subsequent children, meaning no financial support was given specifically for the first child. Additionally, families with higher earnings benefited from **child tax allowances**, which reduced their tax burden depending on the number of children. However, this system was criticized for being inequitable, as it disproportionately benefited wealthier families while excluding lower-income households with no tax liability.\n\nThe introduction of child benefit in 1977 replaced both family allowances and child tax allowances. The new system was designed to be:\n1. **Universal**: It was paid regardless of the family's income.\n2. **Non-taxable**: Families received the payment directly, and it was not taxed.\n3. **Inclusive of the first child**: For the first time, families with only one child could receive a direct payment.\n\n### Policy Evolution\nOver the years, child benefit payments have been adjusted to reflect inflation and changing government priorities. However, in **2013**, the UK government introduced a means-testing mechanism known as the **High-Income Child Benefit Tax Charge**. This meant that families where one parent earned over \u00a350,000 per year would have to repay some or all of the child benefit through their tax return.\n\nIn summary, child benefit payments for the first child were first introduced in April 1977, marking a significant shift in social policy to provide more inclusive financial support for families in the UK.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

This act was a response to the outcry ; it allowed the prisoners to be released on licence as soon as the hunger strike affected their health . They then had a period of time in which they could recover . After a predetermined period of time the prisoner would be rearrested to serve out the rest of their sentence . Conditions could be placed on the prisoner during the time of their release . The hunger strikes themselves were now technically legal .

Officially titled the **Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913**, it was passed by the British government as a response to the hunger strikes undertaken by suffragette prisoners during the women's suffrage movement.\n\n### Background and Context:\nThe suffragettes, particularly members of the militant **Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU)** founded by Emmeline Pankhurst, were fighting for women's right to vote. As part of their protests, many suffragettes were arrested for acts of civil disobedience or vandalism. In prison, some of these women went on hunger strikes to protest their imprisonment and to demand recognition as political prisoners.\n\nThe British government initially responded to these hunger strikes by force-feeding the women, a practice widely condemned as cruel and inhumane. Public opinion began to turn against the government due to the brutality of force-feeding, and suffragettes gained sympathy for their cause. To address this issue, the government introduced the **Cat and Mouse Act**.\n\n### How the Act Worked:\nThe Cat and Mouse Act allowed for the temporary release of hunger-striking prisoners when they became too weak or ill to remain in prison. Once they had sufficiently recovered, they could be re-arrested and returned to prison to complete their sentences. This \"catch and release\" tactic was designed to avoid the political fallout of force-feeding while still undermining the suffragettes' protests.\n\nThe nickname \"Cat and Mouse Act\" came from the way the government treated the suffragettes like a cat playing with a mouse\u2014letting them go only to recapture them later. The Act was heavily criticized by suffragettes and their supporters, who saw it as a cynical way to suppress their movement without addressing their demands for suffrage.\n\n### Aftermath:\nThe Cat and Mouse Act was seen as a failure in terms of suppressing the suffragette movement. It further highlighted the lengths to which the government would go to deny women equal rights, and it only strengthened public sympathy for the suffragettes. The struggle for women's suffrage in the UK continued until partial voting rights were granted to women over 30 in 1918, and full voting rights were achieved in 1928 with the Equal Franchise Act.\n\nThis Act is a significant reminder of the lengths governments and activists went to during the fight for women's suffrage, and it remains a symbol of the suffragettes' resilience and determination.","em":1,"f1":1.0}

The company's Ensenada, Mexico facility, established in 1987, became a major production site not only for amplifiers but also for guitars and other musical equipment. This plant allowed Fender to meet the growing demand for midrange and entry-level gear while keeping production costs lower than in the United States.\n\nThe Ensenada factory produces a variety of Fender amplifiers, including some of the popular models in the Hot Rod series, such as the **Hot Rod Deluxe** and **Hot Rod DeVille**, as well as amplifiers in the Blues series and others. These amplifiers are designed in the United States but are manufactured in Mexico to offer musicians high-quality gear at more accessible price points.\n\nFender's move to manufacture in Mexico is part of its broader strategy to segment its production across different regions. High-end and custom shop products are typically made in the U.S., while more affordable lines are produced in places like Mexico and Asia. Despite the relocation of some amplifier production to Mexico, Fender has maintained its reputation for quality, ensuring that products made in the Ensenada facility meet rigorous standards.\n\nIf you're curious about a specific Fender amplifier model or production history, feel free to ask!","em":0,"f1":0.0}
{"question":"why did ric flair go back to wcw","short_answers":["February 1993"],"long_answer":" Flair triumphantly returned to WCW as a hero in February 1993 , as a result of a `` no - compete '' clause he was unable to wrestle , so he hosted a short - lived talk show in WCW called A Flair for the Gold . Arn Anderson usually appeared at the bar on the show 's set , and Flair 's maid Fifi cleaned or bore gifts . Once he returned to action , Flair briefly held the NWA World Heavyweight Championship for a tenth time after defeating Barry Windham at Beach Blast before WCW finally left the NWA in September 1993 . At Fall Brawl , Flair lost the title , now rebranded the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship , to `` Ravishing Rick '' Rude . At Starrcade in 1993 , Flair defeated Vader to win the WCW World Heavyweight title for the second time . In the spring of 1994 , Flair began a tweener turn and started another feud with longtime rival Ricky Steamboat and challenged Steamboat to a match at Spring Stampede which ended in a no contest from a double pin , causing the title to be held up . Flair then defeated Steamboat in a rematch to reclaim the held - up title on an episode of WCW Saturday Night . The WWE does not count this victory as a new title win . Flair then challenged Col. Robert Parker to wrestle one of his men at Slamboree , which turned out to be Barry Windham , whom Flair defeated , afterwards he quietly turned heel and took Sherri Martel as his manager . He would also wrestle Lord Steven Regal in a five - match series under Marquess of Queensberry Rules , which aired on WCW Worldwide between April 30 and May 28 , in which Flair won the series , with 2 wins , 1 loss , and 2 draws .

Both factors make the question underspecified.","model_short_answer":["Ric Flair returned to WCW in 1993 due to creative differences with WWE and a desire to work closer to home."],"model_long_answer":"Ric Flair's return to World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in the early 1990s was a significant event in professional wrestling history, reflecting both business decisions and personal circumstances. Flair had been one of WCW's (and its predecessor, Jim Crockett Promotions) biggest stars throughout the 1980s before leaving for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in 1991 due to creative and contractual disputes. His decision to go back to WCW in 1993 was motivated by several factors:\n\n### 1. **Conflict with Vince McMahon and WWF Direction**\n   Ric Flair had joined the WWF in 1991 after a falling out with then-WCW president Jim Herd. Herd wanted Flair to take on a radically different character (\"Spartacus\") and reduce his pay, which led Flair to leave WCW. In WWF, Flair initially experienced great success, winning the WWF Championship twice and being part of high-profile feuds. However, by 1993, Flair's position in the WWF began to wane.\n\n   Vince McMahon reportedly wanted to focus more on younger, homegrown talent like Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels. Flair, now in his mid-40s, was seen as an older star from the rival WCW. Flair himself felt he was being phased out of the main event scene. Additionally, Flair was unhappy with the WWF\u2019s grueling travel schedule, which was taking a toll on his health and family life.\n\n   Flair and McMahon reached a mutual agreement to allow him to leave the WWF. McMahon even helped facilitate Flair's return to WCW, showing that their split was amicable.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **WCW's Desire to Rebuild Around Flair**\n   By 1993, WCW was struggling to compete with the WWF. The company needed a proven, iconic star to help boost its credibility and ratings. Flair, as a former WCW\/NWA champion and one of the most recognizable wrestlers in the world, was the perfect choice to help stabilize the company and draw in fans. His return was seen as a homecoming for \"The Nature Boy\" and a way to reestablish WCW's connection to its NWA roots.\n\n   WCW was also under new management by this time. Eric Bischoff had become an executive producer, and the company was distancing itself from the controversial decisions made under Jim Herd\u2019s leadership. Flair was more willing to work with the new WCW management, and they were eager to have him back.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Ric Flair\u2019s Legacy and Loyalty to WCW\/NWA**\n   Flair had spent the majority of his career in Jim Crockett Promotions, which became WCW under Ted Turner\u2019s ownership. He was synonymous with the NWA\/WCW brand and had built his legacy there as a 7-time NWA World Heavyweight Champion before leaving in 1991. Flair had strong ties to the fanbase, the wrestlers, and the history of the promotion. Returning to WCW allowed him to reconnect with those roots and reestablish himself as the face of the company.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Creative Opportunities in WCW**\n   Flair\u2019s return to WCW in 1993 allowed him to once again be a top star. He quickly regained his spot as a main-event performer and was booked in prominent storylines. Shortly after his return, Flair won the NWA World Heavyweight Championship by defeating Barry Windham at Beach Blast 1993. He also engaged in a high-profile feud with Vader, which culminated in a memorable match at Starrcade 1993 where Flair put his career on the line against Vader's WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Flair won the match, further cementing his legendary status.\n\n   WCW provided Flair with creative freedom and opportunities to work with talent he had longstanding relationships with, such as Arn Anderson and other members of the Four Horsemen. This creative environment was more appealing to Flair than what he had experienced in the WWF at the time.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Financial Incentives**\n   Ted Turner\u2019s ownership of WCW meant that the company had significant financial backing. WCW was able to offer Flair a lucrative contract, likely more favorable than what he would have earned in the WWF as his role diminished. Turner valued Flair as a cornerstone of WCW's identity and was willing to invest in his return.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\nRic Flair\u2019s return to WCW in 1993 was the result of a combination of factors: dissatisfaction with his role in the WWF, WCW\u2019s need for a top star to lead the company, and Flair\u2019s own loyalty to the promotion where he had built his reputation. His return was a pivotal moment for WCW, as Flair became a central figure in the company\u2019s efforts to compete with the WWF during the 1990s. While WCW\u2019s rise to prominence would truly take off with the formation of the nWo in 1996, Flair\u2019s presence and star power helped lay the foundation for the company\u2019s success during the Monday Night Wars.","em":0,"f1":0.0909090909}
{"question":"when was the last time the military drafted","short_answers":["1973"],"long_answer":" Conscription in the United States , commonly known as the draft , has been employed by the federal government of the United States in five conflicts : the American Revolution , the American Civil War , World War I , World War II , and the Cold War ( including both the Korean War and the Vietnam War ) . The third incarnation of the draft came into being in 1940 through the Selective Training and Service Act . It was the country 's first peacetime draft . From 1940 until 1973 , during both peacetime and periods of conflict , men were drafted to fill vacancies in the United States Armed Forces that could not be filled through voluntary means . The draft came to an end when the United States Armed Forces moved to an all - volunteer military force . However , the Selective Service System remains in place as a contingency plan ; all male civilians between the ages of 18 and 25 are required to register so that a draft can be readily resumed if needed . United States Federal Law also provides for the compulsory conscription of men between the ages of 17 and 45 and certain women for militia service pursuant to Article I , Section 8 of the United States Constitution and 10 U.S. Code \u00a7 246 . ","category":"Undetermined perspective or granularity","judgment":"underspecified","reasoning":"The request is underspecified because the phrase \u201clast time\u201d can be interpreted from multiple perspectives or granularities. It could refer to the last time a draft was officially implemented, the last time a specific type of draft (e.g., conscription, voluntary enlistment) occurred, or the last time a particular military branch conducted a draft. Without specifying the intended perspective, the question remains underspecified.","model_short_answer":["1973"],"model_long_answer":"The last time the United States conducted a military draft was during the **Vietnam War**, which officially ended for the U.S. in 1973. The draft system, known as **Selective Service**, officially ceased calling individuals for service on **December 7, 1972**, with the last men being inducted into the military in **June 1973**. Since then, the U.S. military has been an all-volunteer force.\n\n### Background on the Draft and Selective Service\nThe draft was first implemented in the U.S. during the **Civil War** (1863), but the modern Selective Service System was established during **World War I** through the **Selective Service Act of 1917**. It was later reestablished for World War II in 1940 and remained in place through subsequent conflicts, including the Korean War and the Vietnam War.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the draft became highly controversial due to widespread opposition to the war itself, as well as perceived inequities in the system. For example, many wealthier or more privileged individuals were able to avoid the draft through college deferments or other exemptions, while those from poorer or minority backgrounds were disproportionately affected.\n\n### Suspension of the Draft\nAfter the Vietnam War, public opposition to the draft and a shift in military policy led to the decision to transition to an all-volunteer military force. In **1973**, the Department of Defense announced it would rely solely on volunteers for military service. However, the Selective Service System was not abolished. Male U.S. citizens and certain immigrant non-citizens between the ages of 18 and 25 are still required to register for Selective Service, as it provides the government with a mechanism to reinstate the draft if necessary during a national emergency.\n\n### Current Status\nThe U.S. has not reinstated the draft since 1973, and it remains highly unlikely, given the effectiveness of the all-volunteer force and the political and societal resistance to conscription. However, the Selective Service System remains active as a contingency plan, and debates about its necessity and fairness occasionally arise, including questions about whether women should also be required to register (as of 2023, women are not required to do so).","em":1,"f1":1.0}

This overlay is themed to \"The Nightmare Before Christmas,\" the beloved 1993 stop-motion film by Tim Burton and Henry Selick. The attraction is transformed annually, combining elements of Halloween and Christmas to celebrate the film\u2019s unique aesthetic of blending the two holidays.\n\n### When Does It Happen?\nThe \"Haunted Mansion Holiday\" overlay typically begins in early September and runs through early January. This timeframe allows it to encompass both Halloween and Christmas seasons. \n\n- **Installation:** The ride typically closes for a few weeks in late August to allow Disney Imagineers to install the overlay.\n- **Opening:** The revamped attraction usually debuts in early September, coinciding with the start of Disneyland's Halloween Time celebration.\n- **Closure:** The overlay remains in place throughout the holiday season and is typically dismantled in early January, when the Haunted Mansion reverts to its classic version.\n\nFor example, in 2023, \"Haunted Mansion Holiday\" began on **September 1, 2023**, and was slated to run through **January 7, 2024**, as part of Disneyland\u2019s seasonal festivities.\n\n### What is Haunted Mansion Holiday?\n\"Haunted Mansion Holiday\" reimagines the original Haunted Mansion as if Jack Skellington, Sally, Oogie Boogie, and other characters from \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\" took over the attraction.

The routing table contains information about the topology of the network immediately around it . The construction of routing tables is the primary goal of routing protocols . Static routes are entries made in a routing table by non-automatic means and which are fixed rather than being the result of some network topology `` discovery '' procedure . ","category":"Undetermined lexicons or references","judgment":"underspecified","reasoning":"The request is underspecified because the phrase \"network connection device that can build tables that identify addresses on each network\" is ambiguous. It could refer to a router (which maintains routing tables for IP addresses) or a switch (which maintains MAC address tables for local network communication). The term \"network\" is vague, and the specific device or table type is not clearly defined. Without clarifying the context or technical specifics, the referent remains ambiguous.","model_short_answer":["Router"],"model_long_answer":"The device you're describing is a **switch**, specifically a **network switch**. A network switch is a hardware device used in computer networking to connect devices within a local area network (LAN) and manage communication between them. Switches operate at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model, but some advanced switches also perform functions at the network layer (Layer 3).\n\n### How a Switch Builds Tables to Identify Addresses\nSwitches use a process called **MAC address learning** to manage network traffic efficiently. Here\u2019s how it works:\n\n1. **MAC Address Table (or Switching Table)**:\n   - A switch maintains a table called the **MAC address table** (sometimes referred to as the forwarding table or content addressable memory, CAM table). This table maps the Media Access Control (MAC) addresses of connected devices to the switch's physical ports. \n   - A MAC address is a unique hardware identifier assigned to a network interface card (NIC) in a device.\n\n2. **Learning Process**:\n   - When a device sends data over the network, the switch receives the Ethernet frame. The frame contains the source MAC address (the sender) and the destination MAC address (the intended receiver).\n   - The switch records the source MAC address and associates it with the port the frame arrived on. This allows the switch to \"learn\" which devices are connected to which ports.\n\n3. **Forwarding Decision**:\n   - If the destination MAC address is already listed in the MAC address table, the switch forwards the frame to the corresponding port, ensuring efficient delivery.\n   - If the destination MAC address is not in the table, the switch floods the frame to all ports except the one it was received on. This ensures the frame reaches its intended recipient, and subsequently, the switch learns the correct port for that MAC address.\n\n4. **Aging**:\n   - MAC address entries in the table are not permanent. Switches use an aging mechanism to remove entries that haven't been used for a certain period. This helps free up space in the table and keeps it updated with active devices.\n\n### Benefits of a Switch in a Network\n- **Improved Efficiency**: Switches reduce unnecessary traffic by forwarding data only to the intended recipient, unlike hubs, which broadcast data to all devices.\n- **Full-Duplex Communication**: Each switch port operates independently, allowing for simultaneous sending and receiving of data, reducing collisions.\n- **Scalability**: Switches can connect a large number of devices in a network, making them suitable for both small and large networks.\n- **Layer 3 Functionality (Optional)**: Some advanced switches, called multilayer switches, can perform routing functions, such as managing IP addresses and directing traffic between different subnets.\n\n### Comparison with Other Network Devices\n- **Hub**: Unlike a switch, a hub broadcasts data to all connected devices, which is less efficient.\n- **Router**: A router operates at the network layer (Layer 3) and is used to connect multiple networks and route traffic between them using IP addresses, not MAC addresses.\n- **Bridge**: A bridge is similar to a switch but operates on a smaller scale and typically connects only a few network segments.\n\nIn summary, a **network switch** is the device you're describing. It identifies devices on the network by building a table of MAC addresses associated with its ports, enabling efficient and direct communication between devices.","em":0,"f1":0.4}

Both factors make the question underspecified.","model_short_answer":["Indirect rule."],"model_long_answer":"The preferred way for European powers to control colonial regions varied over time and depending on the specific colonial power, but generally, European colonialism was characterized by two primary approaches to governance: **direct rule** and **indirect rule**. Both approaches were shaped by the political, economic, and cultural goals of the colonizing powers. Here's a breakdown of these strategies and their implications:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Direct Rule**:\nUnder direct rule, European powers controlled their colonies through centralized administrations, often staffed by European officials. This approach sought to impose the colonizer's political, legal, and cultural systems on the colonized region. The main characteristics of direct rule included:\n\n- **Centralized authority**: Local governance was replaced or heavily influenced by European officials, with decisions made in the interest of the colonizing power.\n- **Elimination of traditional structures**: Indigenous political, legal, and social systems were often dismantled or marginalized in favor of European-style governance.\n- **Assimilation policies**: In some cases, colonizing powers, such as France and Portugal, pursued policies of assimilation, attempting to \"civilize\" local populations by promoting European culture, language, and values.\n\n**Example**: \n- **French Colonies**: France implemented direct rule in many of its colonies, such as Algeria and parts of West Africa. The French legal and administrative system was imposed, and local leaders were often replaced or subordinated to French officials. In Algeria, for instance, France treated the colony as an integral part of France itself, with settlers (colons) enjoying full rights while indigenous Algerians were subjected to discriminatory laws.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Indirect Rule**:\nIn contrast, indirect rule relied on existing local power structures and elites to govern on behalf of the colonizing nation. This was often seen as a more cost-effective method of control and allowed colonial powers to maintain a degree of stability while exploiting resources. The main features of indirect rule were:\n\n- **Utilization of traditional leaders**: Local rulers, chiefs, or other elites were co-opted to enforce colonial policies, collect taxes, and oversee day-to-day administration.\n- **Preservation of traditional systems**: Colonizers often left indigenous political and cultural systems intact, as long as they did not conflict with colonial objectives.\n- **Economic exploitation with minimal interference**: Indirect rule allowed colonizers to extract resources with relatively low administrative costs.\n\n**Example**:\n- **British Colonies**: The British Empire favored indirect rule in many of its colonies, such as Nigeria and India. In Nigeria, for example, the British worked through local chiefs and emirs, leveraging the existing hierarchical structures of traditional societies to maintain control. In India, the British maintained alliances with princely states, allowing local rulers to govern under British oversight.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Other Methods of Control**:\nIn addition to direct and indirect rule, European powers sometimes employed other forms of control, depending on the region and their specific objectives:\n\n- **Settler Colonialism**: In regions like Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa, European settlers displaced indigenous populations and established permanent colonies. These colonies were often governed directly by settlers, and indigenous populations were marginalized or violently suppressed.\n- **Economic Dependency**: In some cases, colonizers sought control primarily through economic means by establishing monopolies over trade, resources, and labor (e.g., the Dutch East India Company in Southeast Asia).\n- **Military Conquest and Force**: Military power was frequently used to suppress resistance and maintain control. For example, in Congo under King Leopold II of Belgium, brutal force was used to exploit resources and suppress dissent.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Motivations Behind Colonial Control**:\nEuropean powers pursued colonial control for several reasons:\n- **Economic exploitation**: Colonies provided raw materials (such as rubber, gold, and cotton) and markets for finished goods.\n- **Strategic advantage**: Colonies were often used to project military power or secure trade routes (e.g., the British control of the Suez Canal).\n- **Cultural and ideological justifications**: Many European powers justified colonization through the belief in the \"civilizing mission\" or \"white man's burden,\" claiming it was their duty to modernize and Christianize \"backward\" societies.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Consequences of Colonial Control**:\nThe methods of colonial control had lasting impacts on colonized regions, including:\n- **Political instability**: The imposition of artificial borders and the disruption of traditional governance created enduring political challenges.\n- **Economic exploitation**: Colonies were often economically underdeveloped, with economies tailored to serve European interests.\n- **Cultural erasure**: Colonization often led to the suppression of indigenous languages, traditions, and religions.\n- **Social hierarchies**: Colonizers frequently divided local populations along ethnic or religious lines, exacerbating tensions that persist to this day.\n\n---\n\nIn summary, European powers generally preferred either direct or indirect rule, depending on the colony and their specific goals. While direct rule allowed for more centralized control, indirect rule was often more cost-effective and relied on co-opting local elites. Both strategies were ultimately aimed at maximizing European dominance, economic exploitation, and political control over colonized regions.","em":1,"f1":1.0}

The law states that:\n- You must be **18 years old or older** to purchase a BB gun.\n- Anyone under the age of 18 is allowed to use a BB gun only under adult supervision and on private property (e.g., at home or a designated shooting range).\n- It is illegal to carry a BB gun in public, as it is considered a realistic imitation firearm.\n\n### **Canada**\nIn Canada, BB guns are not considered firearms if they fire projectiles at less than 500 feet per second (152.4 meters per second). However:\n- You must be **18 or older** to purchase a BB gun.\n- Minors under 18 can use a BB gun, but only with parental consent or adult supervision.\n\n### **Australia**\nBB guns are heavily regulated in Australia and are treated similarly to firearms in most states. To purchase or own a BB gun, you must:\n- Be at least **18 years old**.\n- Obtain the appropriate firearm license, as BB guns are classified as Category A firearms in some states.\n\n### **Other Countries**\nIn most countries, the minimum age to purchase a BB gun is typically 18 years old, although the possession and usage laws may vary. Always check the specific laws and regulations of your location.\n\n### **Tips**\n- If you are under 18 and interested in using a BB gun, it\u2019s important to have a parent or guardian involved to ensure compliance with local laws.\n- Never carry a BB gun in public places or use it irresponsibly, as it can be mistaken for a real firearm and lead to serious consequences.\n- Always prioritize safety, and consider wearing protective gear, especially for your eyes, when using a BB gun.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for more detailed information specific to your area, consult your local laws or contact law enforcement authorities for clarification.","em":0,"f1":0.0571428571}

Historically, the Pro Bowl, which is the NFL's annual all-star game, does not receive as much focus on halftime entertainment as the Super Bowl does. The Pro Bowl halftime acts are typically more low-key, often featuring local or regional performers, community groups, or smaller-scale musical acts compared to the high-profile performances at the Super Bowl.\n\nIn recent years, the Pro Bowl has undergone significant changes. Starting in 2023, the traditional Pro Bowl game was replaced by the **Pro Bowl Games**, which include a variety of events such as skills competitions and non-contact flag football games. This new format emphasizes fun, fan engagement, and player interaction. With this shift in focus, there may or may not be a large-scale halftime performance for the Pro Bowl Games. \n\nTo find out who is performing at the halftime show for this year's Pro Bowl Games, I recommend checking the official **NFL website** or social media platforms closer to the event date, as announcements are typically made in the weeks leading up to the game.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

He appeared in two story arcs across four episodes during the show's first and second seasons. The character, a quirky and obsessive villain with a penchant for hats, was loosely inspired by the version of the Mad Hatter from DC Comics, though the portrayal in the show had a more comedic and campy tone, in keeping with the series' overall style.\n\nDavid Wayne's Mad Hatter was depicted as a thief who specialized in stealing hats, often targeting those of particular significance or value. He also focused on obtaining Batman's cowl as part of his criminal schemes. The Mad Hatter's episodes are:\n\n1. **\"The Thirteenth Hat\" (Season 1, Episode 13)**  \n2. **\"Batman Stands Pat\" (Season 1, Episode 14)**  \n3. **\"The Contaminated Cowl\" (Season 2, Episode 21)**  \n4. **\"The Mad Hatter Runs Afoul\" (Season 2, Episode 22)**  \n\nDavid Wayne brought a theatrical flair to the role, blending menace and whimsy to fit the colorful, over-the-top nature of the show. While the Mad Hatter was not one of the most frequently featured villains in the series, Wayne's performance remains a memorable part of the camp classic *Batman* TV show starring Adam West and Burt Ward.","em":1,"f1":1.0}

It is located in the ultra-exclusive Bel Air neighborhood, which is often associated with Beverly Hills due to its proximity and status as part of the greater Los Angeles area. The house was originally developed by Nile Niami, a Hollywood producer-turned-real estate developer, and designed by architect Paul McClean.\n\n### Key Features of \"The One\":\n- **Size:** Over 105,000 square feet, making it one of the largest private residences in the world.\n- **Price:** Originally listed for $500 million, \"The One\" was considered the most expensive home ever put on the market in the United States. However, it eventually sold for $126 million at auction in early 2022 due to financial and legal issues.\n- **Amenities:** The mansion features 21 bedrooms, 42 bathrooms, a 50-car garage, a 10,000-bottle wine cellar, multiple pools, a nightclub, a bowling alley, a private theater, a 4,000-square-foot guest house, and breathtaking views of Los Angeles.\n\n### Ownership:\nIn March 2022, \"The One\" was sold to Richard Saghian, the CEO of fashion company **Fashion Nova**, during a bankruptcy auction. Saghian, who is known for his fast-fashion empire, outbid several other wealthy buyers to acquire the property. While the final sale price of $126 million was far below the original asking price, it still marked one of the highest transactions for a home in California.\n\n### Background on Nile Niami and Financial Troubles:\nNile Niami initially envisioned \"The One\" as the ultimate luxury property, targeting ultra-wealthy buyers. However, the project faced significant delays, construction overruns, and mounting debts. By 2021, the property was placed into receivership as Niami defaulted on loans exceeding $180 million. This led to the house being auctioned off to settle debts.\n\nAlthough \"The One\" is technically located in Bel Air rather than Beverly Hills, its prominence and size have made it one of the most talked-about properties in the Los Angeles area, often associated with Beverly Hills due to its luxury real estate market. If you're specifically asking about Beverly Hills proper, there are several other notable mansions, but none rival \"The One\" in terms of size or scale.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

In the U.S. government system, the Vice President serves as the President of the Senate according to the U.S. Constitution (Article I, Section 3). This role is largely ceremonial, but the Vice President has the critical ability to cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate when the chamber is evenly split on legislative or procedural matters.\n\nKamala Harris, who assumed office as Vice President on January 20, 2021, has occasionally exercised this tie-breaking power during her tenure, especially considering that, for much of her time in office, the Senate has been closely divided between Democrats and Republicans. Her votes have been pivotal in advancing President Joe Biden's legislative agenda on key issues.\n\nIf you are asking about the **President pro tempore of the Senate**, which is a different position, it is currently held by **Patty Murray**, a Democratic senator from Washington. The President pro tempore is a largely honorary role, traditionally given to the most senior member of the majority party, and serves as the presiding officer of the Senate in the Vice President's absence. Senator Murray became the first woman to hold this position on January 3, 2023.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more details about the roles or the individuals currently serving in these positions!","em":0,"f1":0.0}
{"question":"what states do not allow daylight savings time","short_answers":["Arizona","Navajo"],"long_answer":" Daylight saving time in the United States is the practice of setting the clock forward by one hour during the warmer part of the year , so that evenings have more daylight and mornings have less . Most areas of the United States observe daylight saving time ( DST ) , the exceptions being Arizona ( except for the Navajo , who do observe daylight saving time on tribal lands ) , Hawaii , and the overseas territories of American Samoa , Guam , the Northern Mariana Islands , Puerto Rico , and the United States Virgin Islands . The Uniform Time Act of 1966 established the system of uniform Daylight Saving Time throughout the US . ","category":"Undetermined lexicons or references","judgment":"underspecified","reasoning":"The request is underspecified because the phrase \u201cdo not allow\u201d can be interpreted in multiple ways. It could refer to states that do not observe Daylight Saving Time (DST) at all, or it could refer to states where DST is not enforced in certain regions (e.g., parts of Alaska or Arizona). Additionally, the question lacks clarity on whether it refers to U.S. states or other jurisdictions, and whether it includes territories like American Samoa or Puerto Rico. These ambiguities make the question underspecified.","model_short_answer":["Hawaii","Arizona (except the Navajo Nation)"],"model_long_answer":"As of October 2023, **Hawaii** and most of **Arizona** are the two U.S. states that do not observe Daylight Saving Time (DST). Here's a detailed explanation:\n\n### 1. **Hawaii**\n   - Hawaii does not observe Daylight Saving Time because its geographical location near the equator results in relatively consistent sunrise and sunset times throughout the year. The state decided there was no practical benefit to shifting the clocks twice a year. \n   - Hawaii has never officially adopted DST since the Uniform Time Act of 1966, which standardized the practice across the U.S.\n\n### 2. **Arizona**\n   - Most of Arizona does not observe Daylight Saving Time due to its extreme summer heat. By not \"springing forward,\" Arizona avoids extended evening daylight hours, which would increase energy use for air conditioning.\n   - Arizona has opted out of DST since 1968, utilizing its exemption under the Uniform Time Act.\n   - **Exception in Arizona**: The **Navajo Nation**, which spans parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah, observes DST. This is because the Navajo Nation decided to align with the rest of the country for consistency across its territories. However, the **Hopi Reservation**, which is entirely surrounded by the Navajo Nation, does not follow DST, creating a unique situation in terms of timekeeping.\n\n### Background on Daylight Saving Time:\nDaylight Saving Time was first implemented in the U.S. during World War I, with the idea of conserving energy by making better use of daylight hours in the evening. It was later standardized by the **Uniform Time Act of 1966**, which allows states to opt out of DST if they choose. States that choose not to observe DST remain on **standard time** year-round.\n\n### Other U.S. Territories That Do Not Observe DST\nIn addition to Hawaii and Arizona, several U.S. territories also do not observe Daylight Saving Time:\n   - **Puerto Rico**\n   - **Guam**\n   - **American Samoa**\n   - **U.S. Virgin Islands**\n   - **Northern Mariana Islands**\n\nThese territories, like Hawaii, are located closer to the equator, where daylight hours do not vary significantly throughout the year, making DST unnecessary.\n\n### Current Trends\nIn recent years, there has been increasing debate about whether DST should be abolished nationwide. Some states have passed legislation to permanently adopt daylight saving time or standard time, but federal approval is required to make such changes. For instance, in 2022, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed the **Sunshine Protection Act**, which would make DST permanent across the country, but it has not yet been signed into law or passed by the House of Representatives.\n\nThus, as it stands in 2023, Hawaii and most of Arizona remain the only two states that do not observe Daylight Saving Time.","em":0,"f1":0.4}

This massive quake occurred on **March 27, 1964**, and registered a magnitude of **9.2** on the Richter scale, making it the most powerful earthquake in U.S. history and the second most powerful earthquake ever recorded globally (after the 1960 Valdivia earthquake in Chile, which had a magnitude of 9.5).\n\n### Details of the 1964 Alaska Earthquake:\n- **Location**: The epicenter of the earthquake was located in the Prince William Sound region, about 78 miles (125 km) east of Anchorage, Alaska.\n- **Duration**: The earthquake lasted approximately **4 minutes and 38 seconds**, making it one of the longest recorded earthquakes.\n- **Tectonic Cause**: It occurred along the **Alaska-Aleutian megathrust**, a major subduction zone where the Pacific Plate is being forced under the North American Plate. This tectonic interaction is capable of producing extremely powerful earthquakes.\n- **Depth**: The earthquake originated at a depth of around 25 kilometers (15.5 miles).\n\n### Impacts of the Earthquake:\n1. **Tsunami**: The earthquake generated a massive tsunami that caused destruction along the coasts of Alaska, Canada, and the U.S. West Coast. Waves reached as high as 220 feet (67 meters) in Valdez Inlet, Alaska.\n2. **Damage**: Entire towns were destroyed, particularly in areas like Anchorage, Valdez, and Seward. Infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and buildings suffered extensive damage due to ground shaking and soil liquefaction.\n3. **Loss of Life**: Despite the earthquake's immense power, the death toll was relatively low\u2014**131 people** died. Many of these deaths were caused by the subsequent tsunami rather than the ground shaking itself.\n4. **Economic Effects**: The total damage was estimated at around **$311 million** in 1964 dollars (equivalent to over $3 billion today).\n\n### Notable Geological Effects:\n- The earthquake caused **uplift and subsidence** over a wide area. Some coastal areas were raised by as much as 30 feet, while others dropped by several feet, permanently altering the landscape.\n- It provided valuable research data about plate tectonics and subduction zones, which were still relatively new concepts in geology at the time.\n\n### Legacy:\nThe 1964 Alaska earthquake is remembered as one of the most significant natural disasters in U.S. history. It led to advances in seismic research and disaster preparedness. For instance:\n- The disaster prompted the establishment of the **Alaska Tsunami Warning Center (now the National Tsunami Warning Center)**.\n- Building codes and earthquake-resistant construction practices were improved in Alaska and other earthquake-prone regions.\n\nThis earthquake remains a stark reminder of the immense power of natural forces, particularly in regions located near tectonic plate boundaries.","em":0,"f1":0.4}
{"question":"when does a building need a fire pump","short_answers":["the local municipal water system cannot provide sufficient pressure to meet the hydraulic design requirements of the fire sprinkler system"],"long_answer":" Fire pumps are needed when the local municipal water system can not provide sufficient pressure to meet the hydraulic design requirements of the fire sprinkler system . This usually occurs if the building is very tall , such as in high - rise buildings , or in systems that require a relatively high terminal pressure at the fire sprinkler in order to provide a large volume of water , such as in storage warehouses . Fire pumps are also needed if fire protection water supply is provided from a ground level water storage tank . ","category":"Missing necessary components","judgment":"underspecified","reasoning":"The request is underspecified because it lacks critical contextual details about the building type (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial), its size, or the specific fire safety regulations of the location. These factors determine whether a fire pump is required, as requirements vary based on building classification, occupancy, and local fire codes. Without this information, the question cannot be fully answered.","model_short_answer":["- When the water supply cannot provide adequate pressure to meet the fire protection system's demand.  \n- For buildings with high-rise structures exceeding the height limits of the water supply system.  \n- When required by local fire codes or standards like NFPA 20.  \n- For systems with large flow demands, such as warehouses or industrial facilities."],"model_long_answer":"A fire pump is needed in a building when the available water pressure from the municipal water supply or an on-site water source (like a water tank) is insufficient to meet the pressure requirements of the fire protection systems installed in the building. Fire pumps are critical components of fire protection systems, such as sprinkler systems, standpipes, and fire hydrants, and they are typically required in taller buildings, large facilities, or structures with specific fire safety needs.\n\n### Situations Where a Fire Pump is Needed:\n\n1. **Tall Buildings (High-Rise Structures):**\n   In high-rise buildings, the municipal water supply may not have sufficient pressure to push water to the upper floors for the fire sprinkler systems or standpipes. A fire pump ensures that water can reach the necessary height with adequate pressure.\n\n   - For example, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) sets specific guidelines for the installation of fire pumps in high-rise buildings. NFPA 14 (Standard for the Installation of Standpipe and Hose Systems) and NFPA 20 (Standard for the Installation of Stationary Pumps for Fire Protection) provide detailed requirements.\n\n2. **Large Buildings or Complex Layouts:**\n   In large warehouses, factories, or other expansive structures, the distance from the water supply to the farthest point of the building can result in low water pressure. A fire pump boosts the pressure to ensure adequate coverage throughout the facility.\n\n3. **Insufficient Municipal Water Pressure:**\n   Some municipalities have low water pressure in their water mains, and the pressure may not be adequate to meet the operational requirements of fire protection systems. A fire pump is used to boost the pressure to the required level.\n\n4. **Water Supply from Storage Tanks:**\n   If a building relies on an on-site water storage tank instead of a municipal water source, a fire pump is needed to pressurize the water from the tank and deliver it to the fire protection system.\n\n5. **Code and Regulatory Requirements:**\n   Building codes and fire protection standards often dictate when a fire pump is required. For example:\n   - NFPA 13 (Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems) specifies pressure and flow requirements for sprinkler systems.\n   - Local building codes or fire codes may also mandate the installation of a fire pump based on the building's height, size, or occupancy type.\n\n6. **Specific Occupancy Types:**\n   Certain buildings, such as healthcare facilities, data centers, or industrial plants with hazardous materials, may have higher fire protection requirements. Fire pumps ensure that these systems operate effectively under emergency conditions.\n\n7. **Fire Hydrant Systems:**\n   If the building has a private fire hydrant system, a fire pump may be required to ensure that the hydrants have adequate flow and pressure for firefighting purposes.\n\n### Key Factors That Determine the Need for a Fire Pump:\n\n- **Required Water Flow and Pressure:** This is calculated based on the design of the fire protection system, including the size of the building, occupancy type, and hazard classification.\n- **Height of the Building:** The taller the building, the more pressure is needed to deliver water to upper floors.\n- **Distance to the Water Source:** Long distances between the water source and the fire protection system can result in pressure loss, necessitating a fire pump.\n- **Municipal Water Supply Conditions:** The reliability and pressure of the municipal water supply are critical factors.\n\n### How Fire Pumps Work:\nA fire pump is typically powered by electricity, diesel, or steam. It is activated automatically when the fire protection system detects a drop in water pressure (e.g., when a sprinkler head is activated). The pump then boosts the water pressure to meet the system's requirements.\n\n### Conclusion:\nA fire pump is required in a building if the available water pressure is insufficient to meet the demands of the fire protection systems. This is determined through hydraulic calculations and system design, as outlined in fire safety codes like NFPA 13, NFPA 14, and NFPA 20. Consulting a fire protection engineer or local authority having jurisdiction (AHJ) is essential to determine whether a fire pump is necessary for a specific building project.","em":0,"f1":0.3076923077}

Thus if a legislature makes a law depriving a person of his property , there would be no obligation on the part of the State to pay anything as compensation . The aggrieved person shall have no right to move the court under Article 32 . Thus , the right to property is no longer a fundamental right , though it is still a constitutional right . If the government appears to have acted unfairly , the action can be challenged in a court of law by aggrieved citizens . ","category":"Undetermined standard or preference","judgment":"underspecified","reasoning":"The request is underspecified because the phrase \"is a\" lacks a complete sentence, and the question does not clarify whether it refers to the historical classification (as a fundamental right) or the current status (as a constitutional right) under the Indian Constitution. The answer depends on the temporal context, which is not explicitly provided.","model_short_answer":["Legal right"],"model_long_answer":"The **Right to Property** in the context of the **Constitution of India** has undergone a significant transformation since the Constitution was enacted in 1950. Initially, it was a **fundamental right**, but it was later modified and downgraded to a **constitutional legal right**. Here's a detailed explanation:\n\n### Right to Property as a Fundamental Right (1950-1978)\n- Under the original Constitution of India, the **Right to Property** was enshrined as a **fundamental right** in **Article 19(1)(f)** and **Article 31**.\n  - **Article 19(1)(f):** It guaranteed the right of every citizen to acquire, hold, and dispose of property.\n  - **Article 31:** It protected individuals from being deprived of their property, except by authority of law. This meant that the government could only acquire private property for public purposes and had to provide compensation.\n\n- The provision was intended to protect private property from arbitrary state action. However, it soon became a contentious issue, especially in the context of land reforms and the redistribution of land to address socio-economic inequalities.\n\n- Successive governments faced challenges when implementing land reforms, as the courts often struck down laws that aimed to abolish the zamindari system (a system of land ownership by landlords) or redistribute land. These rulings were based on the protection of the right to property as a fundamental right.\n\n### Shift to a Legal Right (44th Amendment, 1978)\n- In 1978, the **44th Amendment to the Constitution of India** was enacted during the post-Emergency period under the Janata Party government. This amendment removed the **Right to Property** from the list of fundamental rights.\n  - **Article 31 was repealed**, and a new provision, **Article 300A**, was added to the Constitution.\n  - **Article 300A** states: *\"No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law.\"*\n\n- With this amendment, the Right to Property became a **constitutional legal right** rather than a fundamental right. This means that individuals can no longer approach the Supreme Court directly under **Article 32** for violations of the right to property. Instead, they can seek legal remedies in a High Court under **Article 226**.\n\n### Implications of the Change\n1. **Balance Between Public and Private Interest:**\n   - The change facilitated the implementation of land reforms and other socio-economic policies aimed at reducing inequality, as the government gained more flexibility to acquire property for public purposes.\n\n2. **Protection Against Arbitrary Action:**\n   - Even though the Right to Property is no longer a fundamental right, Article 300A ensures that property cannot be taken away arbitrarily by the government. Any deprivation of property must be done through a valid law.\n\n3. **No Direct Access to Supreme Court:**\n   - Since it is no longer a fundamental right, individuals cannot directly approach the Supreme Court under Article 32 if their property rights are violated. They must instead file a case in the appropriate court.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, **Right to Property** is now a **legal constitutional right** under **Article 300A** of the Indian Constitution. While it is no longer a fundamental right, it is still protected against arbitrary action by the state. This change reflects a shift in India's constitutional philosophy, prioritizing socio-economic justice and public welfare over absolute individual property rights.","em":0,"f1":0.5}

The concept of \"new media\" broadly refers to digital communication technologies that enable interactive and user-generated content, as opposed to \"old media\" like newspapers, radio, and television.\n\nHere are key milestones that contributed to the beginning of the age of new media:\n\n### 1. **1960s-1980s: Foundations of Digital Media**\n   - **1969: Birth of the Internet (ARPANET):**\n     The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), the precursor to the modern internet, was established in 1969. It laid the groundwork for global, interconnected digital communication.\n   - **1980s: Rise of Personal Computers:**\n     The introduction of affordable personal computers, such as the IBM PC (1981) and Apple Macintosh (1984), made digital technology accessible to the general public.\n   - **1989: Creation of the World Wide Web:**\n     Tim Berners-Lee developed the World Wide Web while working at CERN. The Web revolutionized how people accessed and shared information, marking a turning point in the evolution of new media.\n\n### 2. **1990s: The Internet Goes Mainstream**\n   - The 1990s are often identified as the decade when the new media age truly began to take shape. This was due to the rapid expansion of the internet, the development of web browsers (like Netscape Navigator in 1994), and the proliferation of websites.\n   - Email, early chat platforms like IRC (Internet Relay Chat), and web-based forums also became popular, enabling new forms of communication and collaboration.\n   - The launch of digital content platforms, such as early online news websites, signaled the shift from traditional media to internet-based media.\n\n### 3. **2000s: Social Media and Mobile Revolution**\n   - The 21st century saw the rise of social media platforms like MySpace (2003), Facebook (2004), YouTube (2005), and Twitter (2006). These platforms allowed users to create and share their own content, fundamentally reshaping media consumption and production.\n   - The introduction of smartphones, particularly the iPhone in 2007, further accelerated the new media age by enabling internet access and multimedia capabilities on mobile devices.\n   - The 2000s also saw the growth of blogging platforms (e.g., WordPress) and streaming services, which challenged traditional media distribution models.\n\n### 4. **Defining Features of the Age of New Media**\n   New media is characterized by several key features:\n   - **Interactivity:** Users can engage with and contribute to content.\n   - **Digitization:** Information is stored and transmitted in digital formats.\n   - **Convergence:** The blending of various media forms (e.g., text, audio, video) into a single digital platform.\n   - **Global Reach:** Content can be instantly accessed and shared worldwide.\n   - **User-Generated Content:** Platforms like YouTube and social media empower users to create and share their own media.\n\n### Summary\nWhile the \"age of new media\" doesn't have a precise starting date, it is generally associated with the late 20th century, particularly the 1990s, when the internet and digital technologies began to transform how people create, consume, and share media. The ongoing evolution of technology\u2014such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and blockchain\u2014continues to shape the new media landscape today.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

This early act of defiance is often linked to **Mangal Pandey**, a young sepoy who became one of the first notable figures of the rebellion.\n\n### Mangal Pandey's Role:\nMangal Pandey, a soldier in the 34th Bengal Native Infantry, is widely regarded as the first individual to openly rebel against the British East India Company. On **March 29, 1857**, at the Barrackpore cantonment, Mangal Pandey attacked British officers, firing the symbolic first shots of resistance. He was reportedly enraged by the introduction of new cartridges for the Enfield rifle, which were rumored to be greased with cow and pig fat\u2014an affront to both Hindu and Muslim religious sentiments. Pandey's act of defiance inspired other sepoys and became a symbol of resistance against British oppression.\n\nHe was later arrested, tried, and executed by hanging on **April 8, 1857**, but his actions sparked unrest among the Indian sepoys and civilians alike.\n\n---\n\n### The Broader Context of the 1857 Rebellion:\nWhile Mangal Pandey is recognized as the first individual to declare mutiny, the rebellion spread quickly across northern and central India. On **May 10, 1857**, sepoys in **Meerut** rose in open revolt, killing their British officers and marching to **Delhi**, where they declared the Mughal Emperor **Bahadur Shah II** as their leader. This marked the beginning of a large-scale uprising against British rule, which lasted over a year and involved soldiers, peasants, and princes.\n\nThe rebellion was fueled by widespread discontent, including:\n- Economic exploitation by the British East India Company.\n- Disrespect for Indian culture and religion.\n- The introduction of Western reforms that threatened traditional Indian society.\n- Grievances among Indian soldiers, who felt they were treated unfairly compared to their British counterparts.\n\n---\n\n### Legacy of Mangal Pandey:\nToday, Mangal Pandey is remembered as one of the first martyrs of India's struggle for independence. His role in the rebellion has been celebrated in Indian history, literature, and films. The 2005 Bollywood movie **\"Mangal Pandey: The Rising\"** dramatized his life and contribution to the rebellion.\n\nIn summary, while the 1857 rebellion was a collective effort involving many leaders, Mangal Pandey is often credited as the first individual to openly declare mutiny against the British, making him a prominent symbol in India's fight for independence.","em":0,"f1":0.5}

Angel Island served as the main immigration station for Asian immigrants, particularly during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It is often referred to as the \"Ellis Island of the West,\" though the experiences of immigrants arriving there were often quite different from those entering the U.S. through Ellis Island in New York Harbor.\n\n### Angel Island Immigration Station (1910\u20131940)\nThe Angel Island Immigration Station operated from **1910 to 1940** and processed hundreds of thousands of immigrants, most of whom were from **China**, **Japan**, and other parts of Asia. It was established during a time of restrictive U.S. immigration policies, particularly under acts like the **Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882** and subsequent laws that severely limited immigration from Asia. \n\nImmigrants arriving at Angel Island often faced long detentions and rigorous interrogations. Unlike Ellis Island, where most European immigrants were processed relatively quickly, Asian immigrants at Angel Island were subjected to intense scrutiny to determine their eligibility to enter the U.S. This was partly due to widespread racism and fears of the so-called \"Yellow Peril,\" which influenced American immigration policies and attitudes at the time.\n\n#### Conditions at Angel Island\nThe conditions at Angel Island were difficult. Immigrants, especially the Chinese, were detained for days, weeks, or even months while their paperwork and legal status were investigated. Many were interrogated extensively, and they had to prove they had immediate family members already residing in the U.S. (as required by restrictive laws like the **Chinese Exclusion Act**). The station's barracks were overcrowded, and the experience was often dehumanizing, leading many to leave behind poems etched into the walls of the detention facilities, expressing their frustration, sorrow, and despair.\n\n### Other Points of Entry on the West Coast\nIn addition to Angel Island, immigrants also entered the U.S. through other major West Coast ports, including:\n- **Seattle, Washington**: Asian immigrants, particularly Japanese and Chinese, also entered through Seattle.\n- **Portland, Oregon**: A smaller number of immigrants entered through this port.\n- **San Pedro\/Los Angeles, California**: By the 20th century, Los Angeles became another entry point for immigrants arriving on the West Coast.\n\n### Immigration Trends and Policies\nImmigration through Angel Island and other West Coast ports was impacted by a series of restrictive immigration laws, such as:\n- The aforementioned **Chinese Exclusion Act (1882)**, which banned most Chinese laborers from entering the country.\n- The **Immigration Act of 1924**, which imposed strict quotas on immigrants from Asia and other non-European regions.\n- The **Gentlemen's Agreement (1907\u20131908)**, which limited Japanese immigration to the U.S.\n\n### Closure of Angel Island\nThe immigration station at Angel Island ceased operations in 1940 after a fire destroyed the administration building. After its closure, the processing of immigrants shifted to other facilities. Today, Angel Island is preserved as a **California State Park**, and the immigration station serves as a museum and historical site, educating visitors about the experiences of immigrants who passed through its gates.\n\n### Modern Immigration on the West Coast\nIn the modern era, West Coast immigration primarily occurs through major international airports (like Los Angeles International Airport and San Francisco International Airport) and border crossings, particularly the U.S.-Mexico border. Nonetheless, Angel Island remains a symbolic and historical reminder of the challenges and contributions of early Asian immigrants to the U.S.","em":0,"f1":0.6666666667}

In Greek mythology, Zeus was the king of the gods and the chief deity, but he was not traditionally the patron of a specific city in the same way that other gods (e.g., Athena for Athens) were. The question assumes a misconception about Zeus's role, leaving the referent ambiguous and requiring clarification.","model_short_answer":["Olympia"],"model_long_answer":"Zeus, the king of the gods in ancient Greek mythology, was not typically associated with being the *patron deity* of a specific city in the way that Athena was for Athens or Apollo was for Delphi. Instead, Zeus was worshipped widely across the Greek world, and his influence was considered universal rather than tied to a single location. That said, there were certain cities and sanctuaries that held particular importance in the worship of Zeus.\n\n### Major Centers of Zeus Worship:\n1. **Olympia**: Perhaps the most famous site associated with Zeus is Olympia, where the ancient Olympic Games were held in his honor. The sanctuary of Zeus at Olympia housed the massive statue of Zeus, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, created by the sculptor Phidias. Olympia was a pan-Hellenic religious and cultural center rather than a city-state's patron deity site.\n\n2. **Dodona**: In northwestern Greece, Dodona was home to one of the oldest oracles in the Greek world and was a major sanctuary dedicated to Zeus. Here, Zeus was worshipped as the god of prophecy, and priests interpreted the rustling of oak tree leaves or the sound of bronze cauldrons to convey his divine will.\n\n3. **Athens**: While Athena was the patron goddess of Athens, Zeus was still worshipped prominently there. The city hosted a large temple dedicated to Zeus, known as the **Temple of Olympian Zeus (Olympieion)**, which was one of the largest temples in the ancient world.\n\n4. **Nemea**: Nemea, in the northeastern Peloponnese, was another important sanctuary for Zeus. The Nemean Games, one of the Pan-Hellenic athletic competitions, were held here in his honor.\n\n### Zeus as a Pan-Hellenic Deity\nUnlike other gods and goddesses who were closely tied to specific cities, Zeus was seen as a unifying figure for all Greeks. His role as the ruler of the gods, the bringer of justice, and the protector of law and order made him a central figure in Greek religion. His worship transcended individual city-states, and his temples and festivals were spread throughout the Greek world.\n\nSo, while Zeus was not the patron god of a particular city, he was venerated in several important religious centers and played a universal role in Greek mythology and religion.","em":1,"f1":1.0}

Constructed on the French side of its borders with Italy , Switzerland , Germany , and Luxembourg , the line did not extend to the English Channel due to French strategy that envisioned a move into Belgium to counter a German assault . ","category":"Undetermined lexicons or references","judgment":"underspecified","reasoning":"The request is underspecified because the term \u201ca system of fortifications\u201d can refer to multiple parallel historical or military structures, such as the Maginot Line or the French Defensive Line. Without specifying which system is meant, the question remains underspecified.","model_short_answer":["Maginot Line"],"model_long_answer":"The system of fortifications along France's border you are likely referring to is the **Maginot Line**. This was a vast line of defensive fortifications constructed by France in the interwar period (1929\u20131938) along its eastern border, primarily with Germany and to a lesser extent Italy. The Maginot Line was designed to prevent or slow down potential attacks from Germany after the devastation of World War I, which had heavily impacted France.\n\n### **Background and Purpose**\nFrance's experience in World War I, particularly the immense loss of life during battles like Verdun, heavily influenced its defense strategy in the years leading up to World War II. The French government wanted a defensive structure that could protect the country from another German invasion. The Maginot Line was named after **Andr\u00e9 Maginot**, the French Minister of War who advocated for its construction.\n\n### **Design and Features**\nThe Maginot Line was an elaborate system of bunkers, underground fortresses, artillery casemates, machine gun emplacements, and anti-tank defenses. The line was divided into heavily fortified sections and less fortified areas, depending on the perceived threat level. Key features included:\n\n- **Fortified Fortresses (Ouvrages):** Massive underground complexes equipped with heavy artillery, living quarters, power plants, and ammunition storage. These were self-sufficient and designed to withstand prolonged sieges.\n- **Smaller Fortifications:** Casemates and pillboxes for infantry and machine guns.\n- **Anti-Tank Obstacles:** Lines of steel rails and concrete blocks to prevent the movement of tanks.\n- **Underground Tunnels:** These connected various parts of the line and allowed for the movement of troops and supplies.\n\nThe fortifications extended along France's border with Germany, Luxembourg, and to a lesser extent, Italy. However, the line was not continuous, as natural obstacles like the Ardennes Forest were thought to be impassable by large armies, and some areas were left less fortified.\n\n### **Strategic Weaknesses**\nWhile the Maginot Line was a formidable defensive structure, it was ultimately flawed in its strategic conception:\n\n1. **Inflexibility:** The Maginot Line was designed for static defense, relying on the assumption that war would be fought in a similar manner to World War I. It did not account for the mobility and speed of modern warfare (blitzkrieg tactics) employed by Germany in World War II.\n   \n2. **Incomplete Coverage:** The line did not extend along the entire French border. For example, the northern border with Belgium was less fortified, as France assumed Belgium's neutrality would prevent an attack from that direction. However, during the German invasion of 1940, the Wehrmacht bypassed the Maginot Line by attacking through Belgium and the Ardennes Forest, where defenses were weaker.\n\n3. **High Cost:** The construction of the Maginot Line consumed significant financial resources, which could have been used for other military purposes, such as building a more mobile army or modernizing equipment.\n\n### **The Fall of France (1940)**\nDuring World War II, the Maginot Line failed to achieve its intended purpose. When Germany invaded France in May 1940, they circumvented the fortifications by advancing through Belgium and the Ardennes, areas the French had considered less vulnerable. Using blitzkrieg tactics, the German forces quickly overwhelmed French defenses, rendering the Maginot Line obsolete in the conflict.\n\n### **Legacy**\nAlthough the Maginot Line is often criticized as a symbol of failed military strategy, it was not a complete failure. The fortifications themselves were well-designed and did hold off German attacks in the areas they covered.

Without additional context or clarification, the exact medical condition or the intended interpretation remains ambiguous.","model_short_answer":["- Possible missed miscarriage  \n- Incorrect dating of pregnancy  \n- Blighted ovum (anembryonic pregnancy)  \n- Further evaluation with follow-up ultrasound or hCG levels recommended"],"model_long_answer":"When an ultrasound at around 7 weeks of pregnancy shows a gestational sac and a yolk sac but no visible embryo or baby, it can lead to questions and concerns. Here's a detailed explanation to help you better understand this situation:\n\n### **Key Terms:**\n1. **Gestational Sac**: The gestational sac is the first structure that forms during early pregnancy. It's the fluid-filled structure in the uterus that surrounds and protects the developing embryo. It can usually be detected by ultrasound around 4.5 to 5 weeks of pregnancy.\n   \n2. **Yolk Sac**: The yolk sac is a small round structure within the gestational sac that provides nutrients to the developing embryo until the placenta takes over. The yolk sac is typically visible on ultrasound by 5.5 to 6 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n3. **Embryo (Baby)**: By the 6th or 7th week of pregnancy, the embryo (or fetal pole) is usually visible on an ultrasound, along with a heartbeat.\n\n### **Possible Reasons for No Embryo at 7 Weeks**\nWhen the gestational sac and yolk sac are present but no embryo is visible at 7 weeks, there are a few possible explanations:\n\n1. **Miscalculation of Gestational Age**:\n   - The most common reason for not seeing an embryo at 7 weeks is that the pregnancy may not be as far along as initially thought. If ovulation or implantation occurred later than expected, the pregnancy might be earlier than 7 weeks, and it may simply be too soon to detect the embryo.\n   - This is especially true if menstrual cycles are irregular, because it can be difficult to pinpoint the exact conception date.\n\n2. **Blighted Ovum (Anembryonic Pregnancy)**:\n   - A blighted ovum occurs when a fertilized egg implants in the uterus and forms a gestational sac but does not develop into an embryo. This is a type of early pregnancy loss and is often due to chromosomal abnormalities in the fertilized egg.\n   - In this case, the gestational sac will continue to grow for a while, but no embryo will develop.\n\n3. **Missed Miscarriage**:\n   - A missed miscarriage (also called a silent miscarriage) happens when the embryo stops developing but remains in the uterus. In this case, the gestational sac and yolk sac may still be visible, but the embryo is not seen or has no heartbeat.\n\n4. **Ectopic Pregnancy**:\n   - Although less common, an ectopic pregnancy (where the fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, such as in the fallopian tube) could also result in the absence of an embryo inside the gestational sac. However, in most cases of ectopic pregnancy, the gestational sac itself would not be located in the uterus.\n\n5. **Technical or Equipment Issues**:\n   - The ultrasound equipment or technique used might not be sensitive enough to detect the embryo. A follow-up ultrasound, especially with a transvaginal scan (which is more detailed in early pregnancy), may provide more clarity.\n\n### **What Happens Next?**\nIf no embryo is visible at 7 weeks, your healthcare provider will likely recommend the following steps:\n\n1. **Follow-Up Ultrasound**:\n   - A repeat ultrasound in 7 to 10 days can help determine whether the pregnancy is progressing. By then, if the pregnancy is viable, an embryo and possibly a heartbeat should be visible.\n\n2. **Blood Tests (hCG Levels)**:\n   - Your doctor may monitor your **human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)** levels. In a healthy pregnancy, hCG levels typically double every 48-72 hours in the first few weeks. Falling or plateauing hCG levels may indicate a non-viable pregnancy.\n\n3. **Evaluate Symptoms**:\n   - Your doctor may ask about any symptoms, such as cramping or bleeding, which could indicate a miscarriage.\n\n4. **Decision-Making**:\n   - If the follow-up tests and ultrasounds confirm that the pregnancy is not viable (e.g., blighted ovum or missed miscarriage), your doctor will discuss options, including waiting for natural miscarriage, using medication to induce miscarriage, or undergoing a dilation and curettage (D&C) procedure.\n\n### **When to Be Concerned**\n- If you experience heavy bleeding, severe cramping, fever, or other unusual symptoms, contact your doctor immediately, as these could indicate complications such as miscarriage or infection.\n\n### **Takeaway**\nIt\u2019s important to remain patient and cautious in this situation. Many pregnancies that show only a gestational sac and yolk sac at 7 weeks may still develop normally, especially if your dates are off. A follow-up ultrasound and hCG testing are crucial to gain more clarity. If the pregnancy is not viable, know that early pregnancy losses are common and often due to factors beyond your control, such as chromosomal abnormalities.\n\nAlways consult your healthcare provider to get a thorough evaluation and support during this uncertain time.","em":0,"f1":0.3703703704}

Without specifying which agreement is intended, the referent remains ambiguous, and the answer depends on contextual clarification.","model_short_answer":["Theodore Roosevelt"],"model_long_answer":"The agreement concerning the future of Korea was negotiated between the United States and Japan, primarily through discussions between U.S. Secretary of War **William Howard Taft** and Japanese Prime Minister **Katsura Taro** in 1905. This negotiation, known as the **Taft-Katsura Agreement**, was an informal exchange of views rather than a formal treaty. It reflected the geopolitical interests of both nations in East Asia during the early 20th century.\n\n### Background\nThe agreement occurred in the context of the **Russo-Japanese War** (1904\u20131905), during which Japan sought to solidify its influence in Korea. At the same time, the United States wanted to maintain its own interests in the Pacific, particularly concerning the Philippines, which it had acquired following the Spanish-American War (1898). Both nations had overlapping strategic goals and sought to avoid conflict by recognizing each other's spheres of influence.\n\n### Key Points of the Taft-Katsura Agreement\n1. **Korean Peninsula**: The United States acknowledged Japan's interest in Korea and effectively accepted Japan's control over the peninsula. This paved the way for Japan to formally annex Korea in 1910.\n   \n2. **Philippines**: Japan, in turn, agreed to recognize U.S. sovereignty over the Philippines and assured that it had no territorial ambitions there.\n\nAlthough the Taft-Katsura Agreement was not a formal, binding treaty, it symbolized a mutual understanding that supported Japan's growing dominance in Korea while protecting U.S. interests in the Pacific.\n\n### Subsequent Developments\n- Following the agreement, Japan continued to expand its influence over Korea, culminating in the signing of the **Eulsa Treaty** (1905), which made Korea a protectorate of Japan. By 1910, Korea was fully annexed by Japan.\n- The agreement is often viewed as an early example of great power diplomacy in East Asia, where the interests of smaller nations like Korea were largely disregarded.\n\n### Legacy\nThe Taft-Katsura Agreement has been criticized for its imperialistic undertones and for sidelining Korean sovereignty. It highlights the broader dynamics of colonialism and power politics that shaped the early 20th century.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

Whether in writing, graphic design, web development, or other creative fields, these tools serve as essential references to ensure that the final product adheres to a standardized approach. Below, I'll explain the value of style guides and style sheets in detail:\n\n---\n\n### **1. What is a Style Guide?**\nA style guide is a set of standards or rules that govern how content is created, formatted, and presented. It provides detailed instructions for areas like grammar, punctuation, tone, formatting, and visual design. Style guides are commonly used in journalism, publishing, corporate branding, and web development.\n\n#### Examples of Popular Style Guides:\n- **The Chicago Manual of Style (CMOS):** Widely used in book publishing, academic writing, and non-journalistic content.\n- **The Associated Press Stylebook (AP):** Primarily used in journalism and news writing.\n- **MLA, APA, and IEEE:** Academic style guides for different fields.\n- **Brand-specific style guides:** Companies like Google, Apple, and Microsoft have their own style guides for content, branding, and design.\n\n---\n\n### **2. What is a Style Sheet?**\nA style sheet is often a shorter, more specific document (or file) that applies the rules from a broader style guide to a specific project, publication, or brand. It typically summarizes key elements like typography, color schemes, spacing, and formatting for consistency. In web development, a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) is a technical document used to control the design and layout of websites.\n\n---\n\n### **Value of Style Guides and Style Sheets**\n\n#### **A. Consistency Across Content**\n- **For Style Guides:** They ensure that all written or visual content adheres to the same rules, creating a unified voice and appearance. For instance, using the same rules for punctuation, capitalization, and formatting across all marketing material avoids confusion and inconsistency.\n- **For Style Sheets:** In design or web development, style sheets ensure that all visual elements (fonts, colors, and spacing) are consistent across pages or platforms.\n\n#### **B. Professionalism and Credibility**\n- Adhering to a style guide conveys professionalism and attention to detail. For example, a news organization that uses AP Style is likely to be seen as more credible because its content adheres to recognized journalistic standards.\n- Similarly, style sheets in web design contribute to a polished website by ensuring that the layout and design are clean and cohesive.\n\n#### **C. Efficiency and Productivity**\n- **For Teams:** Style guides and style sheets save time and effort by providing a clear reference for how to handle certain situations. Instead of debating how to format a headline or which tone to use, team members can consult the style guide or style sheet.\n- **For Automation:** In web development, CSS files automate the application of design rules across multiple web pages, reducing the need for repetitive coding and speeding up the development process.\n\n#### **D. Brand Identity and Recognition**\n- A style guide ensures that a company's identity remains consistent across all platforms. For example, guidelines for using a logo, selecting brand colors, and choosing fonts help maintain a recognizable brand image.\n- Style sheets in visual design or web development reinforce this by standardizing the look and feel of all branded materials.\n\n#### **E. Accessibility and Inclusivity**\n- Many modern style guides prioritize inclusion by recommending gender-neutral language, avoiding offensive terms, and promoting diversity in imagery. \n- In web development, CSS frameworks can include rules to make websites more accessible (e.g., ensuring proper color contrast for users with visual impairments).\n\n#### **F. Scalability**\n- Style guides and style sheets are invaluable when scaling projects or expanding teams. New writers, designers, or developers can quickly familiarize themselves with the established standards, reducing onboarding time and ensuring consistency as teams grow.\n\n#### **G. Error Reduction**\n- By providing clear rules and examples, style guides and style sheets help prevent errors or inconsistencies. For instance, a style guide might specify whether to use Oxford commas or how to format dates, reducing the likelihood of mistakes in published content.\n\n---\n\n### **Use Cases Across Industries**\n\n1. **Publishing and Journalism**\n   - Style guides ensure consistent grammar, punctuation, and style across articles, books, and other written materials.\n   - Example: A news outlet using AP Style will format headlines, dates, and numbers consistently.\n\n2. **Corporate Branding**\n   - A brand style guide might include rules about logo placement, typography, and tone of voice to ensure a cohesive brand identity.\n   - Example: Coca-Cola\u2019s brand guide specifies the exact red color (Pantone 484) and spacing rules for its logo.\n\n3. **Web Development**\n   - CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) dictate how a website looks, ensuring uniformity in design elements like fonts, colors, and margins across pages.\n   - Example: A company\u2019s website uses a CSS file to ensure all headings are the same size and font.\n\n4. **Academic Writing**\n   - A style guide like APA or MLA helps students and researchers format citations, references, and papers consistently, ensuring clarity and adherence to scholarly standards.\n\n5. **Graphic Design**\n   - Style sheets in graphic design define rules for layouts, grid systems, and image usage, ensuring that designs align with the brand\u2019s identity.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nStyle guides and style sheets are indispensable tools for achieving consistency, professionalism, and efficiency in communication and design. They help organizations maintain a cohesive identity, reduce errors, and streamline workflows. Whether you're a writer, designer, or developer, using these tools ensures that your work meets a high standard and resonates effectively with your audience.","em":0,"f1":0.16}

Colonization involved the division and control of African territories by European powers for economic, political, and strategic reasons. By the early 20th century, nearly the entire continent was under European rule, with only a few areas retaining their independence.\n\n### Key Areas of Africa Involved in Colonization\n1. **North Africa**:\n   - Colonized primarily by France, Britain, and Italy.\n   - Examples:\n     - **Algeria**: Colonized by France beginning in 1830, it became a French colony and later a part of France itself.\n     - **Egypt**: Occupied by Britain in 1882 to secure control of the Suez Canal, though it remained nominally part of the Ottoman Empire.\n     - **Libya**: Colonized by Italy in 1911 after being taken from the Ottoman Empire.\n     - **Morocco and Tunisia**: Became French protectorates in 1912.\n\n2. **West Africa**:\n   - Colonized largely by France and Britain, with smaller holdings by Germany, Portugal, and Belgium.\n   - Examples:\n     - **Nigeria, Ghana (then Gold Coast), Sierra Leone, and The Gambia**: Colonized by Britain.\n     - **Senegal, Ivory Coast (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire), Mali, and Niger**: Colonized by France.\n     - **Liberia**: Unique in that it was never formally colonized by European powers. It was established by freed African Americans under the auspices of the American Colonization Society in the 1820s.\n\n3. **Central Africa**:\n   - Colonized by Belgium, France, Germany, and Portugal.\n   - Examples:\n     - **Congo Free State (later Belgian Congo)**: Controlled by King Leopold II of Belgium as his personal possession from 1885 to 1908, then taken over by the Belgian government.\n     - **Cameroon and Chad**: Colonized by France and Germany.\n     - **Angola**: Colonized by Portugal.\n\n4. **East Africa**:\n   - Colonized by Britain, Germany, Portugal, and Italy.\n   - Examples:\n     - **Kenya, Uganda, and Zanzibar**: Colonized by Britain.\n     - **Tanzania (then Tanganyika and Zanzibar)**: First colonized by Germany, then taken over by Britain after World War I.\n     - **Ethiopia**: Successfully resisted colonization by Italy during the First Italo-Ethiopian War (1895\u20131896) but was briefly occupied by Italy from 1936 to 1941 during Mussolini\u2019s fascist regime.\n     - **Somalia**: Split between British Somaliland, Italian Somaliland, and French Somaliland (now Djibouti).\n\n5. **Southern Africa**:\n   - Colonized largely by Britain, Portugal, and Germany, with important Dutch influence in earlier centuries.\n   - Examples:\n     - **South Africa**: Colonized by the Dutch (as the Cape Colony) starting in the 17th century, later taken over by Britain in the 19th century.\n     - **Zimbabwe (then Southern Rhodesia) and Zambia (then Northern Rhodesia)**: Colonized by Britain.\n     - **Namibia (then German South West Africa)**: Colonized by Germany, later taken over by South Africa after World War I.\n     - **Mozambique**: Colonized by Portugal.\n\n6. **Island Territories**:\n   - Islands near Africa were also colonized, including:\n     - **Madagascar**: Colonized by France.\n     - **Seychelles and Mauritius**: Colonized by Britain after earlier French control.\n     - **Cape Verde and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe**: Colonized by Portugal.\n\n### The Exceptions to Colonization:\n- **Liberia**: As mentioned, Liberia was established by freed African American slaves and remained an independent republic, although it came under significant economic and political influence from the United States.\n- **Ethiopia**: Except for the brief Italian occupation (1936\u20131941), Ethiopia successfully resisted European colonization, notably defeating Italy at the Battle of Adwa in 1896.\n\n### Context of Colonization\n- The Berlin Conference (1884\u20131885): This conference, attended by European powers, formalized the partition of Africa without African input. It established rules for claiming African territories and avoided direct conflicts among European nations.\n- Motivations for Colonization: Economic exploitation (e.g., mining, agriculture, and trade), competition for global power, spreading Christianity, and the so-called \"civilizing mission\" were all key drivers of European colonization.\n- Impact of Colonization: The colonization of Africa had profound and often devastating effects, including the exploitation of resources, introduction of arbitrary borders, displacement of local populations, and the suppression of African cultures and governance systems. These impacts continue to affect the continent today.\n\nBy the time of World War I, nearly all of Africa was under European control, with the exceptions of Liberia and Ethiopia. Decolonization began in the mid-20th century, following World War II, as African nations gained independence through negotiations and struggles for freedom.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

The force of his dunk pulled the backboard and support system to the ground, delaying the game.\n\nShaquille O'Neal was known for his immense size and strength, which made him capable of delivering dunks with incredible force.

The league introduced **breakaway rims** and stronger backboards to prevent such occurrences. Breakaway rims are designed to bend downward when enough force is applied, reducing the stress on the backboard and preventing damage.\n\nSince these measures were put in place, no backboards have been broken in an NBA game.

The referents could belong to multiple parallel works, making the question ambiguous.","model_short_answer":["Season 5, Episode 9 ('One, Maybe Two, Ways Out')"],"model_long_answer":"Shawn Spencer tells Juliet O'Hara that he loves her in the popular TV series *Psych* during the episode titled \"Death Is in the Air,\" which is Season 4, Episode 13. This episode originally aired on February 17, 2010.\n\nIn this episode, Shawn and Gus are investigating the theft of a deadly virus from a lab, and during the high-stakes situation, Shawn has a moment of vulnerability. Toward the end of the episode, as he and Juliet are talking, Shawn spontaneously tells her, \"I love you.\" Juliet is caught off guard by the confession, and Shawn quickly tries to play it off as a casual remark, but it\u2019s clear that Shawn\u2019s feelings for Juliet are genuine and serious. This moment marks a significant step in their evolving romantic relationship, which had been building throughout the series.\n\nTheir romance unfolds gradually over the course of the show, with Shawn's feelings for Juliet becoming more apparent as they solve cases together. This heartfelt admission is one of the key moments fans of *Psych* often remember as a turning point in their relationship. They eventually become an official couple in Season 5 and are one of the most beloved pairings in the series.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

{"question":"where does the highway of heroes start and end","short_answers":["between Glen Miller Road in Trenton and the Don Valley Parkway \/ Highway 404 Junction in Toronto"],"long_answer":" By the end of 1952 , three individual highways were numbered `` Highway 401 '' : the partially completed Toronto Bypass between Weston Road and Highway 11 ( Yonge Street ) ; Highway 2A between West Hill and Newcastle ; and the Scenic Highway between Gananoque and Brockville , now known as the Thousand Islands Parkway . These three sections of highway were 11.8 , 54.7 and 41.2 km , ( 7.3 , 34.0 and 25.6 mi ) , respectively . In 1964 , the route became fully navigable from Windsor to the Ontario -- Quebec border . In 1965 it was given a second designation , the Macdonald -- Cartier Freeway , in honour of two Fathers of Confederation . At the end of 1968 , the Gananoque -- Brockville section was bypassed and the final intersection grade - separated near Kingston , making Highway 401 a freeway for its entire 817.9 - km length . On August 24 , 2007 , the portion of the highway between Glen Miller Road in Trenton and the Don Valley Parkway \/ Highway 404 Junction in Toronto was designated the Highway of Heroes , as the road is travelled by funeral convoys for fallen Canadian Forces personnel from CFB Trenton to the coroner 's office in Toronto . On September 27 , 2013 , the Highway of Heroes designation was extended west to Keele Street in Toronto , to coincide with the move of the coroner 's office to the new Forensic Services and Coroner 's Complex at the Humber River Hospital .

It holds deep national significance as the route along which the remains of Canadian soldiers are transported from Canadian Forces Base Trenton to the provincial coroner's office in Toronto. This journey became a poignant tradition during the Afghanistan War (2001\u20132014), where Canadians gathered on overpasses and roadsides to pay their respects.\n\n### Start and End Points:\n1. **Start:** The Highway of Heroes begins at **Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Trenton**, located in Quinte West, Ontario. CFB Trenton is a major military airbase where the remains of fallen soldiers arrive in Canada.\n   \n2. **End:** The honorary designation ends at **Keele Street in Toronto**, which is near the location of the Office of the Chief Coroner in Toronto. This is where the remains are taken for further arrangements.\n\n### Length and Location:\nThis stretch of Highway 401 is approximately **172 kilometers (107 miles)** long and runs through several communities, including Belleville, Port Hope, Oshawa, and Whitby, until it reaches Toronto. The Highway of Heroes designation only applies to this specific segment of Highway 401 and not the entire highway.\n\n### Background:\nThe name \"Highway of Heroes\" was officially assigned to this portion of Highway 401 in 2007 by the Ontario government, following the spontaneous outpouring of respect from Canadians. It was a grassroots movement, as citizens lined the route to honor soldiers who lost their lives in the line of duty. The name reflects the pride and gratitude of Canadians for the sacrifices made by members of the military.\n\nThe \"Highway of Heroes\" is now a symbol of national remembrance and solidarity, and it remains a powerful reminder of the sacrifices made by those who serve in the Canadian Armed Forces. Additionally, a tree-planting initiative called the \"Highway of Heroes Living Tribute\" was later launched to plant 2 million trees along the route, one for every Canadian who has served in uniform since Confederation.","em":0,"f1":0.3428571429}

The exact year varies depending on sources, but General Foods (which was later acquired by Kraft Foods) stopped producing Jell-O Pudding Pops due to declining sales and challenges in maintaining the frozen treat's profitability.\n\n### Background and Popularity\nJell-O Pudding Pops were introduced by General Foods in the late 1970s or early 1980s as a frozen dessert alternative to ice cream. They were marketed as a creamy, smooth dessert made from Jell-O pudding, available in flavors like chocolate, vanilla, and chocolate-vanilla swirl. The product gained significant popularity during the 1980s, aided by a highly successful advertising campaign featuring Bill Cosby, who was then the spokesperson for Jell-O products. The commercials targeted families and children, emphasizing the fun, wholesome aspect of the dessert.\n\n### Decline and Discontinuation\nDespite their initial success, Pudding Pops eventually struggled to maintain their market share. Several factors contributed to their decline:\n1. **Cost and Storage Issues**: Unlike traditional pudding, Pudding Pops required freezer storage and distribution, which was more expensive for manufacturers and retailers.\n2. **Competition**: By the 1990s, the frozen dessert market became increasingly crowded with other brands and products, making it harder for Pudding Pops to stand out.\n3. **Lack of Reinvestment**: Kraft Foods, which acquired General Foods in 1985, did not heavily invest in marketing or innovating the product, leading to a decline in consumer interest.\n\nThese challenges ultimately led Kraft to discontinue Jell-O Pudding Pops as a regular product in grocery freezers during the 1990s.\n\n### Attempts at a Comeback\nAlthough the original frozen Pudding Pops were discontinued, there have been attempts to bring them back in various forms:\n- In the early 2000s, Kraft licensed the Jell-O brand to Popsicle, a division of Unilever, to produce a version of Pudding Pops. However, these were different in taste and texture from the original, and they failed to gain the same popularity.\n- Today, Pudding Pops are no longer widely available in stores, but fans often share recipes for DIY versions to recreate the nostalgic frozen treat.\n\nWhile Jell-O Pudding Pops are no longer a mainstream product, they remain a fond memory for many people who grew up enjoying them during their heyday in the 1980s.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

De Beers ' market share of rough diamonds fell from as high as 90 % in the 1980s to 33 % in 2013 , because of a more fragmented diamond market bringing greater competition , as well as more transparency and greater liquidity . In November 2011 , the Oppenheimer family announced its intention to sell all its 40 % stake in De Beers to Anglo American plc , thereby increasing Anglo American 's ownership of the company to 85 % ( the other 15 % is owned by the Government of the Republic of Botswana ) .

Historically, De Beers controlled as much as **85% to 90% of the world's rough diamond supply** through its monopolistic practices, such as stockpiling diamonds and controlling prices. However, due to significant changes in the industry, legal challenges, and the emergence of competitors, De Beers' market share has significantly decreased over the years.\n\n### Current Market Share\nAs of recent estimates (2023), De Beers controls around **30% to 35% of the global rough diamond market**.

These forced the company to abandon its control of the diamond supply.\n3. **Shifting Industry Practices**: The diamond industry has become more transparent and competitive, with more producers opting to sell diamonds directly rather than through De Beers' once-dominant **Central Selling Organisation (CSO)**.\n4. **Synthetic Diamonds**: The growing popularity of laboratory-grown diamonds has introduced new competition to the market.\n\n### De Beers Today:\nDe Beers is still a vertically integrated company, involved in diamond mining, trading, and retail through its iconic **Forevermark** and **De Beers Jewellers** brands. The company operates mines in Botswana, Canada, Namibia, and South Africa, and its joint ventures with governments (like the Botswana government) remain critical to its production capabilities.\n\nWhile De Beers no longer has the same monopolistic control over the diamond market, it remains a significant player and an influential brand in the diamond industry, particularly in the luxury goods sector.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

Enter the card number (usually a 16-digit number on the front of the card).\n2. Provide the card\u2019s expiration date (printed on the front).\n3. Input the three-digit CVV code (on the back of the card).\n\n**Important Note:** Before using a Visa gift card online, you may need to register the card by linking it to a zip code. This can usually be done on the website or by calling the phone number provided on the card\u2019s packaging. Registration helps ensure that the address you provide during an online checkout matches the card\u2019s registered zip code, reducing the risk of transaction declines.\n\n### Security and Limitations\nWhile the CVV code helps protect against fraudulent use of the card in online or phone transactions, it does not safeguard the card if someone physically steals it. Since Visa gift cards do not have a name associated with them like regular credit cards, anyone with physical possession of the card and CVV code could use it. For this reason, it\u2019s important to keep the card in a secure location and report it immediately if lost or stolen.\n\nIn summary, the CVV code on a Visa gift card is a crucial component for securely using the card in non-physical transactions, such as online or phone purchases. Always keep your CVV code confidential to protect against unauthorized use.","em":0,"f1":0.2222222222}

","category":"Undetermined lexicons or references","judgment":"underspecified","reasoning":"The request is underspecified because the phrase \"Stevia in the Raw\" refers to a specific brand of sweetener, but the question lacks clarity on whether it is asking about the geographical origin of the stevia plant (e.g., Paraguay or Brazil) or the origin of the brand (e.g., the company that produces it). Without specifying the intended referent, the question remains ambiguous.","model_short_answer":["Stevia in the Raw is derived from the leaves of the stevia plant, primarily grown in South America and Asia."],"model_long_answer":"Stevia in the Raw is a brand of sweetener that primarily derives its sweetness from the Stevia plant (*Stevia rebaudiana*), a herb native to South America. The plant is indigenous to parts of Paraguay and Brazil, where it has been used for centuries by indigenous peoples, like the Guarani, to sweeten teas and medicines. The natural sweet compounds in stevia, called **steviol glycosides** (particularly rebaudioside A and stevioside), are what make it remarkably sweet\u2014up to 200 to 300 times sweeter than sugar.\n\n### How Stevia in the Raw Is Made\nStevia in the Raw uses stevia extract as its active sweetening ingredient, specifically isolating the steviol glycosides from the stevia leaves. The process typically involves the following steps:\n1. **Harvesting**: The leaves of the stevia plant are harvested.\n2. **Extraction**: The sweet compounds are extracted from the leaves using water or alcohol-based processes.\n3. **Purification**: The extracted compounds are purified, separating the concentrated steviol glycosides.\n4. **Blending**: To make the product easier to use and similar in bulk to sugar, Stevia in the Raw blends the stevia extract with other ingredients, such as dextrose or maltodextrin (plant-based carbohydrates), or sometimes erythritol in the case of their zero-calorie formulations. This blending ensures that the sweetener measures like sugar, making it more user-friendly for cooking and baking.\n\n### Commercial Production and Sources\nWhile stevia plants originated in South America, they are now grown in various parts of the world, including China, which has become one of the largest producers of stevia. Stevia in the Raw sources its stevia extract from cultivated stevia plants, likely grown in regions ideal for their farming, such as China or South America.\n\n### What Makes Stevia in the Raw Unique?\nStevia in the Raw is marketed as a natural, zero-calorie sweetener, appealing to consumers looking for sugar alternatives with fewer calories. However, it\u2019s important to note that while stevia is derived from a natural plant, the final product undergoes significant processing to extract and purify the sweet compounds.\n\nIn summary, Stevia in the Raw originates from the South American stevia plant, but the commercial product is the result of modern cultivation, extraction, and purification techniques, often involving global farming and manufacturing processes.","em":0,"f1":0.347826087}

Its primary responsibility is to determine how bills will be debated, amended, and voted upon in the House. In essence, the committee acts as a gatekeeper, controlling the flow of legislation and shaping the legislative process. Here are the main functions and powers of the Rules Committee:\n\n### 1. **Setting the Terms for Debate**\n   The Rules Committee determines the specific rules under which a piece of legislation will be considered on the House floor. This includes:\n   - **Time Limits on Debate:** The committee decides how much time will be allocated for debating a bill. This can help speed up or slow down the process.\n   - **Amendments:** The committee determines whether amendments to the bill can be proposed on the floor and, if so, what kind of amendments are allowed.\n\n   For example, the committee can issue:\n   - **Open Rules:** Allowing any member to propose amendments.\n   - **Closed Rules:** Prohibiting any amendments.\n   - **Modified Rules:** Permitting only certain amendments or limiting the scope of changes.\n\n### 2. **Controlling the Legislative Calendar**\n   The Rules Committee decides which bills will be brought to the floor for a vote and when. This gives the committee significant influence over the legislative agenda, as they can prioritize or delay bills according to the majority party's goals.\n\n### 3. **Resolving Disputes on Procedure**\n   The committee helps resolve procedural disagreements, ensuring that the legislative process runs smoothly. It also provides special rules when there are complexities or conflicts related to a particular bill.\n\n### 4. **Shaping the Content and Outcome of Legislation**\n   By controlling how a bill is debated and amended, the Rules Committee has the power to influence the final content of legislation. For instance, by restricting certain types of amendments, the committee can protect a bill from unfavorable changes or ensure it aligns with the majority party\u2019s preferences.\n\n### 5. **Serving the Majority Party**\n   The Rules Committee is often referred to as \"the Speaker's committee\" because it is closely aligned with the majority party leadership. The Speaker of the House typically appoints members to the Rules Committee, and the majority party holds a disproportionate number of seats compared to other committees. This setup allows the majority party to exercise significant control over the legislative process.\n\n### Context and Importance\nThe Rules Committee is particularly important in the House of Representatives because the House has a much larger membership (435 members) compared to the Senate (100 members), and its legislative process is more rigidly structured. The Rules Committee ensures that the House can efficiently manage its workload and prevent legislative gridlock. Without the committee, the sheer volume of bills and amendments could overwhelm the chamber.\n\nHowever, the power of the Rules Committee has also led to criticisms, especially from members of the minority party, who sometimes argue that the committee stifles debate or limits their input by imposing restrictive rules.\n\n### Comparison with the Senate\nThe Rules Committee in the House is unique because the Senate does not have a similar mechanism to control debate and amendments to such a degree. In the Senate, debate is generally unlimited (filibusters are possible), and amendments are more freely offered, which contrasts with the structured and rule-bound process in the House.\n\nIn summary, the House Rules Committee is a critical player in shaping how legislation is debated, amended, and voted on, giving it considerable influence over the legislative process and the priorities of the House.","em":0,"f1":0.1290322581}

However, I can provide some context to clarify why this is the case and how other missions, like New Horizons, have interacted with Pluto.\n\n### Voyager's Mission and Path\nVoyager 1 and Voyager 2 were launched by NASA in 1977 with the primary mission of exploring the outer planets of the Solar System\u2014Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. They were designed to take advantage of a rare alignment of the outer planets that occurs about once every 175 years, allowing the spacecraft to use gravity assists to speed up their journeys and visit multiple planets.\n\nNeither Voyager spacecraft was directed toward Pluto. Here's why:\n- **Voyager 1**: After completing its encounters with Jupiter and Saturn, Voyager 1 was sent on a trajectory out of the Solar System, focusing on interstellar exploration rather than visiting additional planets.\n- **Voyager 2**: Voyager 2 followed a different path, visiting Uranus and Neptune after Jupiter and Saturn. However, it was not directed toward Pluto either, as its trajectory was optimized for exploring these specific outer planets.\n\nAt the time of the Voyager missions, Pluto was not a high-priority target. In 1977, Pluto was still considered the ninth planet of the Solar System, but its small size, great distance, and lack of detailed information made it less of a focus compared to the gas and ice giants.\n\n### New Horizons and Pluto\nThe spacecraft that did reach Pluto was **New Horizons**, which was launched on January 19, 2006. It became the first spacecraft to fly by Pluto, achieving this historic milestone on **July 14, 2015**. The journey took New Horizons **9.5 years** to travel approximately 3 billion miles (4.9 billion kilometers) to Pluto.\n\n### How Voyager's Timing Compares\nIf the Voyager spacecraft had been directed toward Pluto, their travel time would likely have been comparable to New Horizons. However, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 were designed for flybys of the gas giants, and their trajectories were not suited for a direct path to Pluto. Any estimation of how long it would have taken them to reach Pluto would depend on hypothetical mission designs and trajectory calculations.\n\nIn summary, the Voyager spacecraft never reached Pluto, but New Horizons did, and it took 9.5 years to get there. This was a significant achievement, as it provided humanity's first close-up view of Pluto and its moons.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

Without specifying which aspect is meant, the question remains underspecified.","model_short_answer":["Addressing domestic violence through understanding power and control dynamics."],"model_long_answer":"The **Duluth Model** is an intervention program that emphasizes addressing **domestic violence** by focusing on the **patterns of power and control** that abusers exert over victims, particularly in intimate partner relationships. It is a widely used framework for understanding and responding to domestic violence, developed in the early 1980s in Duluth, Minnesota, by a group of feminist activists and domestic violence intervention advocates.\n\n### Key Emphasis of the Duluth Model:\n1. **Power and Control Dynamics**: \n   The Duluth Model is based on the idea that domestic violence is not merely a result of anger or loss of control, but rather a deliberate tactic used by abusers to exert power and maintain control over their victims. It challenges the notion that violence is caused by external factors like stress or substance abuse.\n\n2. **The Power and Control Wheel**:\n   A central tool of the Duluth Model is the **Power and Control Wheel**, which visually represents the various abusive behaviors that an abuser might use to dominate their partner. These behaviors include:\n   - Using intimidation\n   - Emotional abuse\n   - Isolation\n   - Minimizing, denying, and blaming\n   - Using children\n   - Economic abuse\n   - Coercion and threats\n   - Male privilege (originally emphasizing gender dynamics in heterosexual relationships)\n\n   The model highlights how these tactics are interrelated and serve to maintain the abuser's control, with physical violence often being one of the methods used to enforce this power.\n\n3. **Accountability for Abusers**:\n   The Duluth Model focuses on holding abusers accountable for their actions. It does not excuse abusive behavior as a result of mental illness, addiction, or loss of control. Instead, it emphasizes that abuse is a choice and that abusers must take responsibility for their behavior.\n\n4. **Advocacy for Victims**:\n   The model is survivor-centered and prioritizes the safety and empowerment of victims. It seeks to help victims understand the dynamics of abuse, recognize the tactics being used against them, and access resources to leave abusive situations if they choose to.\n\n5. **Group-Based Intervention for Abusers**:\n   The Duluth Model uses **group therapy programs** for abusers, often referred to as **Batterer Intervention Programs (BIPs)**. These programs aim to teach abusers about the dynamics of abuse, help them understand the impact of their behavior on victims, and encourage them to change their attitudes and actions.\n\n6. **Social Change and Gender Analysis**:\n   The Duluth Model emphasizes the need for broader social change to address the societal norms and structures that perpetuate domestic violence. It often incorporates a feminist perspective, particularly in highlighting how traditional gender roles and systemic inequality contribute to the prevalence of abuse.\n\n### Criticism and Debate:\nWhile the Duluth Model is one of the most widely used domestic violence intervention programs, it has also faced criticism. Some argue that it oversimplifies the causes of domestic violence by focusing primarily on power and control, potentially overlooking other contributing factors such as mental health issues, substance abuse, or situational stressors. It has also been critiqued for its gendered framework, which assumes that most abusers are men and most victims are women, though domestic violence can occur in same-sex relationships or involve female perpetrators.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe Duluth Model has been influential in shaping the way domestic violence is understood and addressed, particularly in the United States. Its emphasis on power and control dynamics and holding abusers accountable has made it a cornerstone of interventions and advocacy efforts aimed at reducing domestic violence and supporting survivors.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

Palacio's 2012 bestselling novel of the same name, is a heartwarming and emotional story that centers around themes of acceptance, kindness, empathy, and resilience. Directed by Stephen Chbosky, the film follows the journey of August \"Auggie\" Pullman, a young boy with a rare facial deformity, as he navigates fifth grade at a mainstream school after being homeschooled for most of his life.\n\n### The Meaning of *Wonder*\nAt its core, *Wonder* is a story about embracing differences, overcoming challenges, and the transformative power of compassion. Here are some key themes and messages that help explain the meaning of the movie:\n\n#### 1. **Empathy and Understanding**\n   - The film emphasizes the importance of seeing beyond appearances and understanding others' experiences. Auggie faces bullying and prejudice because of his facial differences, yet as the story unfolds, his classmates and others around him learn to look past his physical appearance and appreciate his kind, intelligent, and funny personality. \n   - *Wonder* reminds audiences of the need to walk in someone else's shoes to better understand their struggles and emotions.\n\n#### 2. **Kindness as a Powerful Force**\n   - One of the movie's most memorable lessons comes from a quote by Mr. Browne, Auggie's teacher: \"When given the choice between being right or being kind, choose kind.\" This mantra encapsulates the central message of the story, showing how small acts of kindness can profoundly impact others' lives.\n   - The movie portrays kindness as contagious; as characters show compassion to Auggie, it inspires others to do the same, creating a ripple effect.\n\n#### 3. **Inner Strength and Resilience**\n   - Auggie's journey highlights the courage it takes to face adversity with dignity and strength. Despite the hurtful comments and stares he endures, Auggie remains brave and learns to embrace his uniqueness. His resilience inspires those around him, showing how inner strength can triumph over societal judgment.\n\n#### 4. **The Importance of Family and Friendship**\n   - Auggie's family plays a central role in supporting him. His parents (played by Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson) and his sister, Via, provide unconditional love and encouragement, helping him navigate the difficulties he encounters.\n   - The movie also explores the value of true friendship. Auggie's friendship with Jack Will, who eventually stands up for him, demonstrates the impact of loyalty and acceptance.\n\n#### 5. **The Ripple Effect of Personal Growth**\n   - The film also explores how Auggie's presence and his struggles influence the people around him. For example:\n     - His sister, Via, feels neglected as the family focuses on Auggie but learns to find her own voice and strength.\n     - Auggie's classmates develop empathy and grow emotionally as they get to know him.\n     - Even minor characters, like those initially antagonistic toward Auggie, undergo personal growth by the end of the story.\n\n#### 6. **Celebrating Individuality**\n   - *Wonder* celebrates the idea that being different is not something to be ashamed of but rather a source of strength and uniqueness. Auggie frequently expresses his love for science and Star Wars, showing that his identity extends far beyond his physical appearance.\n\n### Why the Movie Resonates\n*Wonder* resonates with audiences because it tells a universal and relatable story about acceptance and humanity. Many people have experienced moments of feeling out of place, misunderstood, or judged, and Auggie's story encourages everyone to rise above these challenges with kindness and understanding.\n\nThe movie also touches on the idea that everyone is fighting their own battles, even if they aren't outwardly visible. For example, Via struggles with feeling overshadowed by Auggie's needs, and Auggie's friend Jack hides his family's financial struggles. By showing these different perspectives, *Wonder* encourages viewers to approach others with compassion and open hearts.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, the meaning of *Wonder* lies in its powerful message to \"choose kind,\" embrace differences, and understand that everyone has a story worth hearing. It is a reminder of the profound impact that empathy, love, and acceptance can have in making the world a better place. The movie inspires viewers to see the \"wonder\" in each person, no matter how they look or what challenges they face.","em":0,"f1":0.0714285714}

The circle was constructed in 1930 and was one of the first modern traffic circles in the western United States. \n\nThe design was influenced by European-style roundabouts, which were becoming popular at the time, but it was adapted to the needs of increasing automobile traffic in Southern California. The circle initially connected Pacific Coast Highway (State Route 1), Lakewood Boulevard (State Route 19), and Los Coyotes Diagonal. \n\nOver the years, the Los Alamitos Traffic Circle has undergone several modifications to improve safety and traffic flow. Originally, it operated as an uncontrolled circular intersection, but it was later reconfigured in 1993 to include signals at the entrances to the circle, making it a hybrid of a roundabout and a signalized intersection. This was done to accommodate the high traffic volume and reduce accidents.\n\nToday, the Los Alamitos Traffic Circle is a prominent landmark in Long Beach, known for its historical significance and its role in the city's transportation network. If you're interested in learning more, the traffic circle is often cited as an early example of adapting European traffic design concepts for American roads during the automobile boom of the early 20th century.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

Itachi was ordered to eliminate the Uchiha Clan to prevent a coup d'\u00e9tat that the clan was planning due to their growing discontent with the village leadership.\n\nItachi, however, spared Sasuke because he loved his younger brother deeply and wanted Sasuke to grow strong enough to eventually challenge him as a way to avenge the clan.

It serves multiple functions that are essential for the plant's overall development and interaction with its environment. Below are the main functions of the stem:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Support and Structural Framework**\n   - The stem provides support to the plant, holding leaves, flowers, and fruits in an optimal position for photosynthesis, reproduction, and dispersal. \n   - It helps the plant maintain an upright posture, ensuring that leaves are exposed to maximum sunlight for efficient photosynthesis.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Transport of Water and Nutrients**\n   - **Xylem**: The stem contains vascular tissues such as the xylem, which transports water and dissolved minerals absorbed by the roots to other parts of the plant.\n   - **Phloem**: The phloem, another vascular tissue in the stem, moves the food (produced during photosynthesis in the leaves) to other parts of the plant, including roots and growing regions.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Storage of Food and Water**\n   - In some plants, the stem serves as a storage organ for nutrients and water. For example:\n     - **Potato**: The tuber (a modified stem) stores starch.\n     - **Cactus**: The stem stores water to help the plant survive in arid conditions.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Production of New Growth**\n   - The stem contains **apical (terminal) meristems** and **lateral buds**, which are responsible for the growth of new shoots, branches, and leaves. \n   - The apical meristem at the tip of the stem facilitates vertical (lengthwise) growth, while lateral meristems allow for an increase in girth (secondary growth) in woody plants.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Photosynthesis (in Some Plants)**\n   - In plants like cacti and other succulents, the stem becomes green and performs photosynthesis in the absence of significant leaf structures. These stems are often thick and fleshy, adapted to conserve water.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Reproductive Functions**\n   - The stem helps in the positioning of flowers and fruits, ensuring successful pollination, fertilization, and seed dispersal.\n   - Some plants use stems for vegetative propagation, where new plants grow from stem cuttings, runners, or stolons (e.g., strawberries).\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Protection**\n   - In certain plants, stems have adaptations like thorns (e.g., in roses) or spines (e.g., in cacti) that protect the plant from herbivores or grazing animals.\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Climbing and Support in Certain Plants**\n   - In climbers like grapes or ivy, stems develop tendrils or other support structures that help the plant attach itself to external supports and grow upward for better access to sunlight.\n\n---\n\n### 9. **Hormone Transport and Signal Conduction**\n   - The stem plays a crucial role in transporting hormones (plant growth regulators) and other signaling molecules throughout the plant, coordinating growth, development, and responses to environmental stimuli.\n\n---\n\n### Examples of Modified Stems\nSome stems are specialized for unique functions:\n   - **Rhizomes**: Underground stems (e.g., ginger) that store nutrients and help in vegetative reproduction.\n   - **Tubers**: Swollen underground stems for food storage (e.g., potatoes).\n   - **Bulbs**: Modified stems with fleshy leaves for nutrient storage (e.g., onions).\n   - **Stolons**: Horizontal stems that grow above the ground and help in propagation (e.g., strawberries).\n\n---\n\n### Summary\nThe stem is essential for the plant's growth, nutrient and water transport, structural support, and reproduction. It also stores food and water, facilitates photosynthesis in some species, and plays an adaptive role in defense and environmental interaction. Each of these functions contributes to the plant's ability to thrive in its specific habitat.","em":0,"f1":0.3157894737}

After sedimentation , especially when using a centrifuge to press it into a compact mass , the precipitate may be referred to as a ' pellet ' . Precipitation can be used as a medium . The precipitate - free liquid remaining above the solid is called the ' supernate ' or ' supernatant ' . Powders derived from precipitation have also historically been known as ' flowers ' . When the solid appears in the form of cellulose fibers which have been through chemical processing , the process is often referred to as regeneration . ","category":"Undetermined perspective or granularity","judgment":"underspecified","reasoning":"The request is underspecified because the phrase \"when\" can be interpreted from multiple perspectives: it could refer to the timing of a specific chemical reaction (e.g., a particular step in a reaction sequence) or the general conditions under which precipitates form (e.g., solubility thresholds, temperature, or concentration changes). Without clarifying the context or specific reaction, the question remains open to multiple interpretations.","model_short_answer":["When the product of a reaction is an insoluble solid in the reaction medium."],"model_long_answer":"In chemistry, a precipitate forms during a chemical reaction when two solutions are mixed, and the reaction produces an insoluble solid. This solid, known as the precipitate, separates from the liquid mixture and settles at the bottom or becomes suspended in the solution. Precipitation reactions typically occur in aqueous solutions (solutions where water is the solvent) and are driven by the solubility rules of ionic compounds.\n\n### Key Conditions for Precipitate Formation\n1. **Insoluble Product Formation**: A precipitate forms when the product of a chemical reaction is insoluble in the solvent (usually water). The solubility of compounds in water depends on their chemical nature, and solubility rules help predict whether a compound is soluble or insoluble.\n   \n2. **Double Displacement Reactions**: Precipitation often occurs in double displacement (or double replacement) reactions, where two ionic compounds in aqueous solution exchange ions to form new compounds. If one of the new compounds is insoluble, it precipitates out of solution. For example:\n   \\[\n   AB (aq) + CD (aq) \\rightarrow AD (s) + CB (aq)\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( AD \\) is the precipitate if it is insoluble in water.\n\n3. **Supersaturation**: A precipitate can also form when a solution becomes supersaturated, meaning it contains more dissolved solute than it can hold at a given temperature. This typically happens when the solution cools or when a chemical reaction increases the concentration of the insoluble product.\n\n4. **Exceeding Solubility Product (Ksp)**: The solubility product constant (\\( K_{sp} \\)) is a measure of how much of a compound can dissolve in water. If the ionic product (the product of ion concentrations in solution) exceeds the \\( K_{sp} \\), the solution becomes supersaturated, and the excess ions combine to form a precipitate.\n\n---\n\n### Example of a Precipitation Reaction\nAn example of a precipitation reaction is the reaction between aqueous solutions of silver nitrate (\\( AgNO_3 \\)) and sodium chloride (\\( NaCl \\)):\n\\[\nAgNO_3 (aq) + NaCl (aq) \\rightarrow AgCl (s) + NaNO_3 (aq)\n\\]\nIn this reaction, silver chloride (\\( AgCl \\)) is an insoluble salt, which forms a white precipitate, while sodium nitrate (\\( NaNO_3 \\)) remains dissolved in water.\n\n---\n\n### Solubility Rules\nTo predict whether a precipitate will form, you can use general solubility rules for ionic compounds in water:\n1. **Soluble Compounds**:\n   - Most compounds containing alkali metal ions (\\( Li^+, Na^+, K^+, etc. \\)) and the ammonium ion (\\( NH_4^+ \\)) are soluble.\n   - Nitrates (\\( NO_3^- \\)), acetates (\\( CH_3COO^- \\)), and most perchlorates (\\( ClO_4^- \\)) are soluble.\n   \n2. **Insoluble Compounds**:\n   - Most carbonates (\\( CO_3^{2-} \\)), phosphates (\\( PO_4^{3-} \\)), sulfides (\\( S^{2-} \\)), and hydroxides (\\( OH^- \\)) are insoluble, except for those of alkali metals and \\( NH_4^+ \\).\n   - Most silver (\\( Ag^+ \\)), lead (\\( Pb^{2+} \\)), and mercury (\\( Hg_2^{2+} \\)) salts are insoluble, except for their nitrates, acetates, and perchlorates.\n\n---\n\n### Visual and Practical Identification of Precipitate Formation\n- **Appearance**: A precipitate often appears as a cloudy or solid residue within the liquid solution.\n- **Separation**: Over time, the solid may settle at the bottom of the container or can be filtered out.\n- **Testing Solubility**: Chemists often consult solubility rules or perform qualitative tests to confirm the formation of a precipitate.\n\nBy understanding solubility rules, reaction types, and the factors that affect solubility, you can predict and identify when a precipitate will form in a chemical reaction.","em":0,"f1":0.375}

It refers to the process by which populations move from urban areas (cities) to suburban areas (outlying residential communities), often resulting in the expansion of metropolitan regions. Below are some of the key reasons for suburbanization:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Economic Growth and Rising Incomes**\n- As countries become more economically developed, individuals typically experience rising incomes, which allows them to afford larger homes with more land \u2014 a feature more commonly found in suburban areas.\n- Suburbanization is often tied to the growth of the middle class. In the post-World War II era, for example, increasing prosperity in countries like the United States, Canada, and Western European nations allowed families to seek larger, more comfortable living spaces outside dense urban centers.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Advancements in Transportation**\n- Improvements in transportation infrastructure, such as the development of railroads, streetcars, and later automobiles, made it feasible for people to live farther away from their places of work in city centers. \n- The invention and mass production of the automobile in the 20th century (e.g., by companies like Ford) played a particularly significant role in suburbanization. Cars allowed people to commute long distances more efficiently, enabling them to live in suburban areas while still working in urban areas.\n- Governments in developed countries also invested in road systems and highway networks (e.g., the Interstate Highway System in the U.S.), which facilitated suburban development.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Desire for Homeownership and Space**\n- Suburban areas often provide more space, privacy, and access to nature compared to dense urban areas. Many families in developed countries prioritize having single-family homes with yards, which are more readily available in the suburbs.\n- Suburbs can also offer a quieter, less congested environment compared to cities, making them attractive to families with children.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Post-War Housing Policies**\n- After World War II, housing shortages in urban areas led to government and private-sector initiatives to build new homes in the suburbs. For example, in the United States, programs like the GI Bill provided loans to returning soldiers, making homeownership more accessible.\n- Large-scale suburban housing developments, such as Levittown in New York, were built to accommodate the growing demand for affordable housing in the post-war era.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Urban Decline and Push Factors**\n- In many developed countries during the mid-20th century, urban centers experienced challenges such as overcrowding, pollution, crime, and deteriorating infrastructure. These \"push factors\" encouraged people to move to suburban areas that were perceived as safer and cleaner.\n- For example, in the U.S., the phenomenon of \"white flight\" in the mid-20th century saw many white, middle-class families leaving cities for the suburbs as urban areas became more racially diverse or experienced economic and social decline.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Technological Advancements**\n- The advent of telecommunication technologies, such as the internet, has allowed more people to work remotely, reducing the need to live close to work in city centers. This trend has accelerated in the 21st century, especially during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Consumer Culture and Suburban Lifestyle**\n- Suburbanization is also tied to a cultural narrative in many developed countries that values suburban living as synonymous with the \"ideal\" lifestyle. Suburbs are often marketed as the best place to raise families, with access to good schools, parks, and shopping centers.\n- The development of suburban shopping malls and other amenities has made suburbs more self-sufficient and appealing.\n\n---\n\n### **8. Government Policies and Zoning Laws**\n- Governments have historically incentivized suburbanization through policies such as tax breaks for homeownership and subsidies for suburban development.\n- Zoning laws in many developed countries have also encouraged suburban growth by designating large areas for single-family homes and restricting dense urban development.\n\n---\n\n### **Examples of Suburbanization in More Developed Countries**\n- **United States**: Suburbanization accelerated after World War II, with the rise of car culture and government policies that encouraged suburban homeownership. Today, suburbs account for a significant portion of the U.S. population.\n- **United Kingdom**: Suburban growth began in the 19th century with the expansion of railway systems and continued in the 20th century with the development of \"garden cities\" and suburban housing estates.\n- **France**: Suburbanization has been driven by urban sprawl around major cities like Paris. However, French suburbs (\"banlieues\") tend to have a mix of affluent areas and economically disadvantaged zones.\n- **Australia**: Suburbanization has been a defining feature of Australian cities like Sydney and Melbourne, driven by a cultural preference for single-family homes and government support for suburban development.\n\n---\n\n### **Challenges of Suburbanization**\n- **Urban Sprawl**: Suburbanization often leads to urban sprawl, with negative environmental impacts, such as habitat destruction, increased greenhouse gas emissions from commuting, and reduced agricultural land.\n- **Economic Inequality**: Suburbanization can exacerbate socioeconomic divides, with wealthier populations moving to suburbs while poorer populations remain in urban areas.\n- **Infrastructure Strain**: Rapid suburban growth can strain infrastructure, including roads, public schools, and utilities.\n\n---\n\nIn conclusion, suburbanization in more developed countries is the result of a complex interplay of economic prosperity, technological advancements, cultural preferences, and government policies. While it has provided many families with improved living conditions, it also presents significant social and environmental challenges.","em":0,"f1":0.2068965517}

This was the final service pack for Office 2010, and it includes all previous updates and patches since the initial release of the software.\n\n#### Key Details About Office 2010 SP2:\n- **Release Date:** July 16, 2013\n- **Improvements:** \n  - Fixes stability issues in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and other Office applications.\n  - Enhances compatibility with Windows 8 and Internet Explorer 10 (both of which were new at the time).\n  - Includes bug fixes and security patches.\n  - Performance improvements for large datasets when working with Excel and other Office applications.\n\n#### How to Check Your Office 2010 Version:\n1. Open any Office 2010 application (e.g., Word or Excel).\n2. Click on the \"File\" tab.\n3. Select \"Help\" or \"Account\" (depending on your version).\n4. Look for the version number. If it says **Service Pack 2** or a build number like **14.0.7015.1000**, you already have the latest version.\n\n### End of Support and Recommendations\nSince Office 2010 is no longer supported by Microsoft as of October 2020, users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to a newer version of Office, such as:\n- **Microsoft 365** (formerly Office 365): A subscription-based service that ensures you always have the latest version of Office applications.\n- **Office 2021**: A one-time purchase, non-subscription version of Office, released in October 2021, which includes modern features and continued support.\n\nContinuing to use Office 2010 after its end of support can expose you to security risks, as Microsoft no longer provides updates to patch vulnerabilities. If you're still using Office 2010, consider upgrading to a supported version for improved functionality and security.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

{"question":"what is the secret of the law of attraction","short_answers":["the belief that by focusing on positive or negative thoughts people can bring positive or negative experiences into their life"],"long_answer":" In the New Thought philosophy , the law of attraction is the belief that by focusing on positive or negative thoughts people can bring positive or negative experiences into their life . The belief is based on the idea that people and their thoughts are both made from `` pure energy '' , and that through the process of `` like energy attracting like energy '' a person can improve their own health , wealth and personal relationships . ","category":"Undetermined lexicons or references","judgment":"underspecified","reasoning":"The request is underspecified because the term \u201claw of attraction\u201d is ambiguous and can refer to multiple parallel concepts, such as the spiritual law of attraction, the legal principle of attraction, or the scientific law of attraction. Without specifying which one is meant, the question remains underspecified.","model_short_answer":["Focus on positive thoughts and emotions to attract desired outcomes."],"model_long_answer":"The \"secret\" of the **Law of Attraction** is often described as the belief that you can attract into your life whatever you focus on, think about, and believe in. It is rooted in the idea that thoughts and emotions emit a kind of energy or vibration that interacts with the universe, drawing experiences and circumstances that match the nature of that energy. This concept is widely popularized by self-help books, motivational speakers, and films, such as the 2006 documentary-style film and book *The Secret* by Rhonda Byrne.\n\nAt its core, the Law of Attraction is based on three main principles:\n\n### 1. **Like Attracts Like**\n   - This principle suggests that similar energies attract one another. If you maintain positive thoughts, emotions, and expectations, you will attract positive outcomes and experiences. Conversely, negative thoughts and feelings can attract undesirable situations.\n   - For example, if you believe you are capable and worthy of success, you are more likely to take actions that lead to success, while also attracting opportunities that align with those beliefs.\n\n### 2. **Ask, Believe, Receive**\n   - **Ask**: Clearly identify what you want and \"ask\" the universe for it. This might involve writing down your goals, visualizing your desires, or setting intentions.\n   - **Believe**: Wholeheartedly trust that what you desire is already on its way. This step requires cultivating a mindset of faith and removing doubts or fears.\n   - **Receive**: Allow yourself to experience the emotions of already having what you want. By feeling gratitude and acting as though your desire is already fulfilled, you're said to align yourself with its manifestation.\n\n### 3. **Focus on Positive Energy**\n   - It emphasizes that your thoughts and emotions are powerful forces. By focusing on love, joy, gratitude, and abundance, you attract similar positive experiences into your life. For example, practicing gratitude for what you already have can help shift your mindset to one of abundance rather than scarcity.\n\n---\n\n### The \"Secret\" According to *The Secret*\nIn Rhonda Byrne's *The Secret*, the Law of Attraction is presented as a universal law, much like gravity, that governs every aspect of our lives. The \"secret\" is understanding how to apply this law intentionally to manifest your goals, whether they relate to wealth, relationships, health, or personal growth.\n\nSome key ideas from the book include:\n- **Visualization**: Visualizing your goals and desires in detail is a tool for focusing your thoughts and emotions on what you want.\n- **Gratitude**: Acknowledging and feeling grateful for what you already have amplifies positive energy, making it easier to attract more good things.\n- **Emotional Alignment**: Feeling the emotions associated with having achieved your desires (e.g., happiness, excitement) helps align you with the frequency of your goals.\n\n---\n\n### Criticism and Scientific Perspective\nWhile the Law of Attraction has gained widespread popularity, it is not supported by scientific evidence in its \"vibrational\" or \"universal energy\" sense. Critics argue that it oversimplifies complex realities, such as systemic barriers, social factors, and randomness in life. Furthermore, it can place undue blame on individuals who face adversity, suggesting that they \"attracted\" negative circumstances through their thoughts.\n\nHowever, some aspects of the Law of Attraction align with psychological principles:\n- **Positive Thinking**: Studies show that optimism and a positive mindset can improve mental health, resilience, and problem-solving abilities.\n- **Goal Setting and Visualization**: These are effective tools in many self-improvement and success frameworks. Visualization, in particular, has been shown to improve performance by mentally rehearsing desired outcomes.\n- **Self-Fulfilling Prophecy**: Believing in your ability to succeed can influence your behavior and increase your chances of achieving your goals.\n\n---\n\n### Practical Takeaway\nWhether or not you believe in the metaphysical claims of the Law of Attraction, its principles can encourage positive habits, such as focusing on goals, practicing gratitude, and maintaining a hopeful outlook. The \"secret\" may simply lie in how these practices shape your mindset and behavior, making it more likely for you to notice and act on opportunities that align with your desires.","em":0,"f1":0.2068965517}

Below is an overview of notable milestones for smoking bans in public places:\n\n### **United States**\nIn the United States, the movement to ban smoking in public places began at the local level in the late 20th century. California was the first state to implement a statewide ban on smoking in indoor public spaces, including restaurants and workplaces, in **1995**, with bars added in **1998**. Over the years, other states followed suit, and by the early 2000s, smoking bans had expanded to include most public indoor spaces in many states. However, there is no federal smoking ban, so regulations vary by state and municipality.\n\n### **United Kingdom**\nThe UK introduced a comprehensive smoking ban in public places in phases:\n- **Scotland**: The first part of the UK to implement a full ban on smoking in enclosed public spaces, including pubs and restaurants, was Scotland on **March 26, 2006**.\n- **Wales and Northern Ireland**: Both introduced similar bans on **April 2, 2007**, and **April 30, 2007**, respectively.\n- **England**: England followed with its own smoking ban on **July 1, 2007**. This legislation made it illegal to smoke in all enclosed public spaces and workplaces.\n\n### **European Union**\nThe European Union has encouraged its member states to adopt smoking bans. Countries like Ireland were pioneers in the EU, with Ireland becoming the first country in the world to implement a nationwide ban on smoking in all public indoor workplaces, including bars and restaurants, on **March 29, 2004**. Other countries in Europe followed with similar legislation, often implemented in the mid-to-late 2000s.\n\n### **Australia**\nAustralia introduced smoking bans gradually. The first state to ban smoking in enclosed public places, including restaurants, was South Australia in **1999**. Other states and territories followed, with comprehensive smoking bans across the country implemented by the mid-2000s.\n\n### **Canada**\nCanada also saw smoking bans enacted at the provincial level. In **2004**, New Brunswick became the first province to pass a law banning smoking in all enclosed public places. By **2008**, all Canadian provinces had enacted similar bans.\n\n### **Other Notable Countries**\n- **New Zealand**: Smoking was banned in all indoor public places, including bars and restaurants, on **December 10, 2004**.\n- **India**: A nationwide smoking ban in public places came into effect on **October 2, 2008**.\n- **China**: Smoking bans in public places were introduced in some cities like Beijing in the 2010s, though enforcement remains a challenge.\n\n### General Context\nSmoking bans were introduced as part of public health campaigns to reduce the harms caused by secondhand smoke exposure and to encourage smokers to quit. These bans were often accompanied by other measures, such as restrictions on tobacco advertising, increased taxes on cigarettes, and public education campaigns about the risks of smoking.\n\nIf you're referring to a specific country or region, let me know, and I can provide more detailed information about the smoking ban timeline there!","em":0,"f1":0.0}

Without clarifying which event is intended, the question remains ambiguous and requires additional context to resolve.","model_short_answer":["The U.S. took possession of Wake Island on January 17, 1899."],"model_long_answer":"The United States took formal possession of Wake Island on **January 17, 1899**. This occurred during the era of U.S. expansionism following the Spanish-American War (1898). Wake Island, a small atoll in the Pacific Ocean, was uninhabited at the time and strategically located between Hawaii and Asia, which made it important for future military and communication purposes.\n\n### Context and Historical Background:\n\nWake Island was first encountered by Europeans in 1568 when Spanish explorer \u00c1lvaro de Menda\u00f1a de Neira sighted it. However, it remained largely unnoticed for centuries. The United States claimed the island under the **Guano Islands Act of 1856**, which allowed the U.S. to take possession of unclaimed islands containing guano deposits (a valuable fertilizer at the time). However, there is no evidence that guano mining ever took place on Wake Island.\n\nThe formal annexation of Wake Island in 1899 was carried out by the U.S. Navy. This act was part of broader U.S. efforts to establish a stronger presence in the Pacific, following the acquisition of the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico as territories after the Spanish-American War.\n\n### Significance of Wake Island:\n\n1. **Strategic Location**: Wake Island's location in the central Pacific Ocean made it an important stopover point for trans-Pacific shipping and aviation. It lies roughly halfway between Hawaii and the Philippines.\n\n2. **Use as a Cable and Aviation Hub**: In the early 20th century, Wake Island's strategic importance grew with the advent of telecommunications and aviation. In 1935, Pan American Airways established a trans-Pacific seaplane base on Wake Island as part of its \"China Clipper\" route between the United States and Asia.\n\n3. **World War II**: Wake Island became highly significant during World War II. After the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Wake Island was assaulted by Japanese forces. Despite a valiant defense by U.S. Marines and civilians, the island fell to the Japanese on December 23, 1941. It remained under Japanese control for most of the war until it was bypassed by U.S. forces as part of their \"island-hopping\" strategy.\n\n### Modern Status:\n\nToday, Wake Island is an unorganized, unincorporated territory of the United States, administered by the U.S. Air Force under an agreement with the Department of the Interior. It is primarily used as a military refueling and staging point and remains uninhabited except for military and contractor personnel.\n\nThus, the U.S. annexation of Wake Island in 1899 was a key step in establishing American dominance in the Pacific, setting the stage for its later strategic and military significance.","em":0,"f1":0.4615384615}

Floating both conductors , not referencing either one to ground , minimizes the pickup of hum from any nearby alternating current ( AC ) power wires . ","category":"Undetermined lexicons or references","judgment":"underspecified","reasoning":"The request is underspecified because the term \"idle line voltage\" is not a standard or widely recognized term in electrical engineering or power systems. Additionally, the phrase \"in Australia\" could refer to different contexts (e.g., power grid standards, specific equipment specifications), but the question lacks clarity on the exact technical or contextual meaning intended. Without further details, the referent remains ambiguous.","model_short_answer":["230V"],"model_long_answer":"The idle line voltage in Australia refers to the standard voltage present on a telephone line when no call is in progress (i.e., the line is \"on hook\"). In most countries, including Australia, this voltage is known as the \"on-hook voltage\" and is typically provided by the telephone exchange to indicate that the line is functional.\n\n### Idle Line Voltage in Australia:\nIn Australia, the idle (on-hook) line voltage for telephone systems is typically **48 volts DC**. This is in line with the global standard for analog Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) systems. The voltage may vary slightly depending on the specific equipment and distance from the telephone exchange but generally remains in the range of **-48V to -52V DC**.\n\n### Key Points About Idle Line Voltage:\n1. **Polarity**: The voltage is usually negative, meaning the positive side of the circuit is grounded, and the negative side carries the -48V.\n2. **Purpose**: This voltage is used to power basic telephone equipment (such as traditional landline phones) and to signal that the line is connected to the network.\n3. **On-Hook Condition**: When the phone is \"on hook\" (idle), there is no current flow, and the line voltage is maintained at -48V DC.\n4. **Off-Hook Condition**: When the phone is \"off hook\" (in use), the voltage drops as current flows through the circuit, typically reducing to around **6 to 12 volts DC**, depending on the distance from the exchange and the impedance of the telephone equipment.\n\n### Standards in Australia:\nAustralia follows telecommunication standards governed by the **Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA)**. The telecommunications system is part of the global legacy of standards that originated from the Bell System in the United States, which also uses -48V DC as the standard for idle line voltage.\n\n### Why -48V DC?\nThe use of -48V DC in telecommunications systems worldwide (including Australia) is due to several practical and historical reasons:\n- **Safety**: 48V DC is considered low enough to be safe for humans under normal conditions.\n- **Corrosion Prevention**: The negative voltage helps reduce electrochemical corrosion on the telephone wires.\n- **Historical Legacy**: The standard was established in the early days of telephone systems and has persisted due to its effectiveness and widespread adoption.\n\n### Modern Context:\nWhile analog telephone lines (POTS) are still in use in some areas, many households and businesses in Australia have transitioned to digital communication systems like the **National Broadband Network (NBN)**. These systems may not use traditional analog line voltages, as the infrastructure is based on modern digital and VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) technology.\n\nIf you're troubleshooting or working with older telephone systems in Australia, it's important to measure the line voltage correctly and ensure the equipment is designed for use with the country's telecommunications standards.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

Their relationship is marked by fits and starts, misunderstandings, and personal growth, but they ultimately get together and find happiness.\n\n### Season 1: The Beginning of Their Romance\nWill and Emma\u2019s romantic tension begins in the very first season of *Glee*. Emma, the school\u2019s guidance counselor, harbors feelings for Will early on, despite the fact that he is married to Terri Schuester. Will, too, develops feelings for Emma, but he remains conflicted because of his marital status. By the end of Season 1, Will discovers that Terri had been faking a pregnancy, which leads to their separation.

Will\u2019s feelings for Emma remain, but the two are unable to pursue a relationship due to Emma's commitment to Carl and her struggles with OCD.\n\n---\n\n### Season 2: Obstacles to Their Relationship\nIn Season 2, Emma and Carl get married in Las Vegas, but their relationship is short-lived. Emma eventually confesses that she is still a virgin, which highlights the lack of intimacy in her marriage, likely due to her lingering feelings for Will and her struggles with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Carl ultimately leaves her, and their marriage is annulled.\n\nToward the end of Season 2, Will begins to see hope for a future with Emma. However, Emma\u2019s OCD continues to be a significant barrier in their relationship. When Will encourages her to seek professional help, she begins therapy and starts taking medication, which helps her manage her condition.\n\n---\n\n### Season 3: The Official Beginning of Their Relationship\nIn Season 3, Will and Emma finally get together as a couple. Their relationship becomes official early in the season, and they are depicted as happy and supportive partners. Will proves to be patient and understanding of Emma\u2019s OCD, and the two work together to navigate her challenges.\n\nLater in Season 3, Will proposes to Emma in the episode \u201cYes\/No\u201d (Season 3, Episode 10). He organizes an elaborate musical proposal with the help of the New Directions (the glee club he leads), and Emma says yes. This solidifies their commitment to each other and sets the stage for their future together.\n\n---\n\n### Season 4: Wedding Day Drama\nIn Season 4, Will and Emma plan their wedding, but complications arise.

If the car is slowed initially by manual use of the automatic gear box and final stoppage is by use of the handbrake the engine will not shut down . ","category":"Undetermined standard or preference","judgment":"underspecified","reasoning":"The request is underspecified because it lacks clarity on the specific conditions or timing criteria for the auto start-stop system to engage. For example, it does not specify whether the question refers to the vehicle's default settings, the driver's actions (e.g., idling), or the vehicle's operational mode (e.g., city vs. highway driving). Without this context, the answer depends on assumptions about the vehicle's configuration or usage scenario.","model_short_answer":["- When the vehicle is stationary (e.g., at a red light or in traffic).  \n- When the brake pedal is fully pressed (in automatic transmissions).  \n- When specific conditions like engine temperature, battery charge, and cabin climate are optimal."],"model_long_answer":"Auto start-stop systems are designed to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions by automatically shutting down the engine when the vehicle comes to a stop and restarting it when the driver is ready to move again. The engine will automatically shut down under specific conditions, which depend on the vehicle's design, driving conditions, and system settings. Here are the typical scenarios in which an auto start-stop system will shut off the engine:\n\n### Common Conditions for Auto Start-Stop to Shut Down the Engine:\n1. **The Vehicle is Stationary:**\n   - The engine will shut off when the car has come to a complete stop, such as at a red light, in heavy traffic, or during a stop at an intersection.\n   - The brake pedal must typically be fully depressed (for vehicles with automatic transmissions) or the clutch pedal released (for manual transmissions) to activate the system.\n\n2. **The Engine is Warm:**\n   - Auto start-stop systems often require the engine to be at a normal operating temperature to ensure smooth restarts. If the engine is still cold (e.g., shortly after starting the car), the system may not activate.\n\n3. **Battery Charge is Sufficient:**\n   - The system monitors the vehicle's battery level. If the battery has enough charge to support the electrical systems (lights, air conditioning, infotainment, etc.) while the engine is off, the system will allow the engine to shut down. If the battery is too low, the engine will stay on to recharge it.\n\n4. **Cabin Climate is Stable:**\n   - The system checks the climate control settings. If the cabin temperature is within the desired range set by the driver, the engine will shut off. However, if the air conditioning or heating is working hard to maintain the temperature (e.g., in very hot or cold weather), the engine may remain on to power the system.\n\n5. **The Driver\u2019s Seatbelt is Fastened, and the Door is Closed:**\n   - Some systems require the driver\u2019s seatbelt to be fastened and the driver\u2019s door to be closed for the start-stop system to activate. If either condition isn\u2019t met, the system may not shut off the engine.\n\n6. **The Vehicle is on Level Ground:**\n   - In some cases, auto start-stop may not activate if the vehicle is on a steep incline or decline, as this could affect the smoothness of the restart or safety.\n\n7. **The Steering Wheel is Not Being Turned:**\n   - If the driver is actively turning the steering wheel while stationary (e.g., during parking maneuvers), the system might keep the engine running to maintain power steering functionality.\n\n8. **The Engine Load is Low:**\n   - If there is minimal electrical or mechanical load on the engine (e.g., no heavy use of the alternator, air compressor, or other systems), the start-stop system is more likely to shut off the engine.\n\n### Scenarios When Auto Start-Stop May Not Shut Down the Engine:\nThere are also situations where the system is intentionally overridden, and the engine will not shut down:\n- **Frequent Stops:** If the system detects frequent stop-and-go traffic, it may temporarily disable itself to avoid excessive wear and tear on the starter motor or battery.\n- **Extreme Weather Conditions:** In very hot or cold weather, the system may keep the engine running to ensure the cabin remains comfortable or to prevent damage to the engine.\n- **Towing or Heavy Loads:** If the vehicle is towing a trailer or carrying a heavy load, the engine may stay on to ensure adequate power is available.\n- **Malfunctions or System Errors:** If there is an issue with the start-stop system itself, it may not function as intended. In such cases, a warning light may appear on the dashboard.\n\n### How the System Restarts the Engine:\nOnce the engine has shut down, the system will restart it automatically when the driver takes specific actions, such as:\n- Releasing the brake pedal (in automatic transmissions).\n- Pressing the accelerator pedal (in some systems).\n- Depressing the clutch pedal (in manual transmissions).\n\n### Benefits of Auto Start-Stop:\n- **Fuel Savings:** By turning off the engine during idle periods, the system reduces fuel consumption.\n- **Lower Emissions:** It helps reduce CO2 and other pollutant emissions, making the vehicle more environmentally friendly.\n- **Reduced Engine Wear:** Modern start-stop systems are designed to minimize wear on components like the starter motor and battery.\n\n### Limitations:\n- Some drivers find the system intrusive or notice slight delays during restarts.\n- In certain situations, the system may not provide significant fuel savings, such as in highway driving or in areas with minimal stops.\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure about how the auto start-stop system works in your specific vehicle, consult the owner\u2019s manual for detailed instructions and settings. Many vehicles also allow you to disable the system temporarily or permanently if you prefer.","em":0,"f1":0.0}

As the land from Lake Okeechobee slopes gradually to Florida Bay , water flows at a rate of half a mile ( 0.8 km ) a day . Before human activity in the Everglades , the system comprised the lower third of the Florida peninsula . The first attempt to drain the region was made by real estate developer Hamilton Disston in 1881 . Disston 's sponsored canals were unsuccessful , but the land he purchased for them stimulated economic and population growth that attracted railway developer Henry Flagler . Flagler built a railroad along the east coast of Florida and eventually to Key West ; towns grew and farmland was cultivated along the rail line .

Here are the major results of Florida's railroad expansion:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Economic Growth and Development**\n   - **Agriculture Expansion**: The railroads provided Florida farmers with a faster, more efficient way to transport their crops, especially citrus fruits, to markets in the northern U.S. This helped establish Florida as a major agricultural state. Crops like oranges, grapefruits, and sugarcane became key exports.\n   - **Tourism Industry**: Railroads played a pivotal role in developing Florida\u2019s tourism industry. Wealthy industrialists like Henry Flagler and Henry Plant built hotels along the rail lines, catering to wealthy northerners who came to Florida to escape the cold winters. This marked the beginning of Florida as a tourist destination.\n   - **Trade and Ports**: Railroads facilitated the movement of goods to Florida\u2019s ports, boosting trade. Cities like Jacksonville and Tampa grew as trade hubs, exporting goods like phosphate, lumber, and seafood.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Urbanization and Population Growth**\n   - **New Towns and Cities**: The expansion of rail lines led to the founding and growth of many towns and cities in Florida. For example:\n     - **Miami** was essentially developed because of Henry Flagler\u2019s extension of the Florida East Coast Railway to the area in 1896.\n     - **Tampa** experienced significant growth due to the arrival of Henry Plant\u2019s railroad and the establishment of the cigar industry in Ybor City.\n   - **Population Boom**: The accessibility provided by railroads encouraged migration to Florida, both from other U.S. states and abroad. This contributed to the rapid growth of the state\u2019s population, particularly in urban areas.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Transportation Network**\n   - The creation of a statewide rail network connected previously isolated regions of Florida. Before the railroads, much of Florida was inaccessible, with swamps, forests, and poor roads making travel difficult. The railroads linked the northern, central, and southern parts of the state, making it easier for people and goods to move around.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Development of Southern Florida**\n   - **Florida Keys and Overseas Railroad**: One of the most ambitious railroad projects was Henry Flagler\u2019s Overseas Railroad, which connected the mainland to Key West in 1912. This project opened up the Florida Keys to development and tourism, though it was later damaged by a hurricane in 1935.\n   - **Everglades Development**: The railroads played a role in developing areas near the Everglades, as they allowed people to settle in previously inaccessible regions. While this led to economic benefits, it also had long-term environmental consequences.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Environmental Impact**\n   - The expansion of railroads into Florida\u2019s wilderness areas led to deforestation, draining of wetlands, and other environmental changes. While this was necessary for development, it also disrupted ecosystems, particularly in the Everglades.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Social and Cultural Changes**\n   - **Diversity**: The railroads brought a diverse group of people to Florida. Immigrants, including Italians, Cubans, and African Americans, moved to the state to work on the railroads or in industries supported by the railroads, such as farming and cigar production.\n   - **Segregation**: Like other parts of the South, Florida\u2019s railroads were segregated during the Jim Crow era, and African Americans were often relegated to inferior conditions on trains.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Economic Disparities**\n   - While the railroads brought prosperity to some areas, other regions that were bypassed by the rail lines remained underdeveloped. This sometimes led to economic disparities between different parts of the state.\n\n---\n\n### Notable Figures in Florida Railroad Development:\n   - **Henry Flagler**: Often called the \u201cFather of Florida Tourism,\u201d Flagler extended the Florida East Coast Railway down the Atlantic coast, reaching Miami and later the Florida Keys.\n   - **Henry Plant**: Plant developed the railroads in western Florida, particularly around Tampa, and was instrumental in connecting the Gulf Coast to the rest of the country.\n\n---\n\nIn summary, the development of Florida\u2019s railroads was a key driver of the state\u2019s economic, social, and physical transformation.

During this period, Vietnam was part of **French Indochina**, a colonial federation established by France in Southeast Asia. Here's a breakdown of the names and contexts for this era:\n\n### 1. **French Indochina (Indochine fran\u00e7aise)**:\n   - From 1887 to 1945, Vietnam was under French colonial rule as part of French Indochina, which also included Laos and Cambodia. \n   - French Indochina was organized into several administrative entities, with Vietnam divided into three regions:\n     - **Tonkin (B\u1eafc K\u1ef3)**: The northern region, including Hanoi.\n     - **Annam (Trung K\u1ef3)**: The central region, with Hue as its cultural and royal center.\n     - **Cochinchina (Nam K\u1ef3)**: The southern region, including Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City).\n   - These divisions reflected the administrative and political structure imposed by the French, with Cochinchina governed as a colony, while Tonkin and Annam were protectorates. \n\n### 2. **Historical Names for Vietnam**:\n   - Throughout its history, Vietnam has been known by various names. Some of these names were still culturally and historically significant before World War II:\n     - **\u0110\u1ea1i Nam**: This was the official name of the country during the Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty (1802\u20131945), which ruled Vietnam before and during French colonization. \"\u0110\u1ea1i Nam\" means \"Great South.\"\n     - **Annam**: This name, meaning \"Pacified South,\" was given by Chinese dynasties during Vietnam's time as a vassal state of China. The French later used \"Annam\" to refer to the central part of Vietnam.\n     - **Vietnam (Vi\u1ec7t Nam)**: This name has historical roots and was used intermittently in Vietnamese history. It became the official name again after the August Revolution in 1945, when H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh declared the independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.\n\n### 3. **Japanese Occupation (1940\u20131945)**:\n   - During World War II, Vietnam (as part of French Indochina) came under Japanese occupation in 1940. While the French colonial administration nominally remained in place under Vichy France, Japan exerted significant control over the region.\n   - In March 1945, Japan ousted the French and declared Vietnam independent under Emperor **B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i**, the last emperor of the Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty. However, this \"independence\" was largely a puppet state under Japanese influence, and it lasted until Japan's defeat in August 1945.\n\n### Summary:\nBefore World War II, the area we now call Vietnam was primarily referred to as **French Indochina** under colonial rule, with Vietnam divided into the regions of Tonkin, Annam, and Cochinchina. Historically, the term **\u0110\u1ea1i Nam** was also used during the Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty. The name **Vietnam** became prominent after the country's declaration of independence in 1945.","em":1,"f1":1.0}

British victory seemed inevitable , as the more heavily armed Serapis used its firepower to rake Bonhomme Richard with devastating effect . The commander of the Serapis finally called on Jones to surrender . He replied , `` Sir , I have not yet begun to fight ! '' Jones eventually managed to lash the ships together , nullifying his opponent 's greater maneuverability and allowing him to take advantage of the larger size and considerably more numerous crew of Bonhomme Richard . An attempt by the Americans to board Serapis was repulsed , as was an attempt by the British to board Bonhomme Richard . Finally , after another of Jones 's ships joined the fight , the British captain was forced to surrender at about 10 : 30 p.m. The Bonhomme Richard -- shattered , on fire , leaking badly -- defied all efforts to save her and sank about 36 hours later at 11 : 00 a.m. on Saturday , 25 September 1779 .

The ship \"Bonhomme Richard\" was involved in the Battle of Yorktown (1781), but the user may be conflating the ship's name with the battle's name. Without clarifying whether the question refers to the ship, the battle, or a specific event, the referent remains ambiguous.","model_short_answer":["Off the coast of Flamborough Head, England"],"model_long_answer":"The Battle of Bonhomme Richard vs. HMS Serapis, one of the most famous naval engagements of the American Revolutionary War, took place on **September 23, 1779**, in the **North Sea**, off the coast of Flamborough Head, England. This battle was part of a daring naval campaign led by Captain John Paul Jones, often called the \"Father of the American Navy.\"\n\n### Context of the Battle:\nJohn Paul Jones commanded the American warship **USS Bonhomme Richard**, a former French merchant ship refitted for war. His mission was to disrupt British shipping and weaken their naval power. The Bonhomme Richard was part of a small squadron of American and French ships that raided British shipping lanes in the North Sea and around the British Isles.\n\nIn the evening of September 23, Jones encountered the **HMS Serapis**, a more modern and heavily armed British frigate commanded by Captain Richard Pearson. The two ships engaged in a fierce and brutal battle.\n\n### Details of the Battle:\n- The battle began just after sunset and lasted for several hours. Despite being heavily outgunned and with the Bonhomme Richard suffering severe damage, Jones famously declined to surrender, reportedly declaring, **\"I have not yet begun to fight!\"**\n- In a dramatic turn of events, Jones maneuvered his damaged ship close to the Serapis, and the two vessels became entangled. This allowed Jones's crew to board the Serapis and engage in hand-to-hand combat.\n- After a prolonged and grueling fight, Jones and his crew forced the British to surrender.\n\n### Aftermath:\nThe Bonhomme Richard was so badly damaged that it sank shortly after the battle, but Jones and his crew transferred to the captured Serapis. The victory was a significant morale boost for the Continental Navy and established Jones as a legendary figure in naval history. It also demonstrated that the fledgling American navy could challenge the powerful Royal Navy on its own waters.\n\nThe battle site, near Flamborough Head in the North Sea, remains a historically significant location and is remembered for Jones's remarkable tenacity and skill in the face of overwhelming odds.","em":0,"f1":0.4444444444}
{"question":"what is the full form of cfc's","short_answers":["Chlorofluorocarbons"],"long_answer":" Chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) are fully halogenated paraffin hydrocarbons that contain only carbon , chlorine , and fluorine , produced as volatile derivative of methane , ethane , and propane . They are also commonly known by the DuPont brand name Freon . The most common representative is dichlorodifluoromethane ( R - 12 or Freon - 12 ) . Many CFCs have been widely used as refrigerants , propellants ( in aerosol applications ) , and solvents . Because CFCs contribute to ozone depletion in the upper atmosphere , the manufacture of such compounds has been phased out under the Montreal Protocol , and they are being replaced with other products such as hydrofluorocarbons ( HFCs ) ( e.g. , R - 410A ) and R - 134a . ","category":"Undetermined lexicons or references","judgment":"underspecified","reasoning":"The request is underspecified because the acronym \"CFC's\" can refer to multiple parallel entities across different fields (e.g., \"Consumer Financial Counseling,\" \"Centralized Financial Control,\" or \"Council for the Conservation of the Environment\"). Without specifying the context or domain, the referent remains ambiguous.","model_short_answer":["Chlorofluorocarbons"],"model_long_answer":"The full form of **CFCs** is **Chlorofluorocarbons**. \n\n### What Are CFCs?\nCFCs are a group of man-made chemical compounds that consist of **chlorine, fluorine, and carbon** atoms. They are classified as halocarbons and are primarily used as refrigerants, aerosol propellants, and in the production of foam-blowing agents and solvents.\n\n### Historical Background\nCFCs were first developed in the 1920s and 1930s as a safer alternative to chemicals like ammonia and sulfur dioxide, which were previously used as refrigerants. The properties of CFCs\u2014non-flammability, low toxicity, and chemical stability\u2014made them widely popular in industrial and consumer applications for much of the 20th century.\n\n### Environmental Impact\nBy the late 20th century, scientists discovered that CFCs were extremely harmful to the environment, specifically to the **ozone layer**, which protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation. When released into the atmosphere, CFCs rise to the stratosphere, where ultraviolet light causes them to break down, releasing chlorine atoms. These chlorine atoms initiate reactions that deplete ozone molecules, contributing to the **ozone hole**.\n\n### Global Action to Phase Out CFCs\nThe environmental risks associated with CFCs led to global action to reduce and eventually eliminate their use. The **Montreal Protocol**, an international treaty adopted in 1987, was a landmark agreement aimed at phasing out the production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances, including CFCs. The treaty has been widely regarded as one of the most successful environmental agreements in history, and many CFCs have been replaced by alternative chemicals like **hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)**, which have a much lower impact on the ozone layer (though they still contribute to global warming).\n\n### Summary\nCFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons) were once a widely used class of chemicals for industrial and consumer applications, but their harmful effects on the ozone layer led to their global regulation and replacement under international agreements like the Montreal Protocol. Their story is a significant example of how science and policy can address global environmental challenges.","em":1,"f1":1.0}

","category":"Undetermined standard or preference","judgment":"underspecified","reasoning":"The request is underspecified because the phrase \"killed\" is ambiguous in the context of Yellowstone's wolf population. Wolves in Yellowstone are protected under the Endangered Species Act, so \"killed\" could refer to historical hunting, relocation, or other interventions. Without clarifying the specific event or definition of \"killed,\" the question lacks a clear referent or standard.","model_short_answer":["The last wolf pack in Yellowstone was killed in the 1920s."],"model_long_answer":"The last wolf pack in Yellowstone National Park was eradicated in the 1920s. Wolves were systematically hunted, trapped, and killed in Yellowstone as part of a federal predator control program aimed at protecting livestock and increasing game populations such as elk and deer. By 1926, the last known wolf pack in the park had been destroyed, and wolves were effectively eliminated from Yellowstone and much of the contiguous United States. \n\nThis loss of wolves had profound ecological consequences. Without natural predators, prey populations like elk grew unchecked, leading to overgrazing and significant environmental degradation. For decades, this absence disrupted the balance of the Yellowstone ecosystem, creating cascading effects on vegetation, other wildlife, and river systems.\n\nEfforts to restore wolves to Yellowstone gained momentum in the late 20th century, fueled by a growing understanding of their critical role in maintaining ecological balance. In 1995 and 1996, wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park as part of a controversial but successful recovery program. Gray wolves (Canis lupus) were brought in from Canada, and the population quickly grew, re-establishing wolf packs in the park. This reintroduction is often cited as one of the most important and successful wildlife conservation efforts in U.S. history, and it demonstrated the concept of a \"trophic cascade,\" where the presence of a top predator helps regulate an ecosystem. \n\nToday, Yellowstone is home to several wolf packs, and their presence has helped restore ecological balance to the park.

Her reappearance marks the resolution of her abduction storyline, which had been ongoing since Episode 6, **\"Ascension\"**.\n\n### Context of Scully's Absence:\nScully's temporary departure from the series was written into the plot due to Gillian Anderson's real-life pregnancy. To accommodate this, the show's writers created an abduction storyline in which Scully is kidnapped by Duane Barry, a former FBI agent and alien abductee. This begins in Episode 5, **\"Duane Barry\"**, and continues into Episode 6, **\"Ascension\"**, where she is taken by shadowy forces after Barry delivers her to them.\n\nDuring her absence, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) becomes deeply invested in finding her, and the storyline focuses on his pursuit of the truth behind her disappearance.

While the exact details of her abduction remain ambiguous, this episode is a pivotal moment in the series, strengthening the bond between Mulder and Scully and deepening the show's mythology.\n\n### After Her Return:\nFollowing her recovery, Scully resumes her role as Mulder's partner and continues to be a skeptic counterpoint to his belief in the paranormal. The trauma of her abduction becomes an ongoing thread in the series, influencing her character development and her personal investment in the larger conspiracy surrounding aliens and government cover-ups.\n\nIf you're watching the series, Episode 8 is a highly emotional and significant installment that not only brings Scully back but also highlights the deep connection between Mulder and Scully, which is central to the show.","em":0,"f1":0.2}

After completing his education in England, he returned to India as a medical officer in the Indian Medical Service in 1881. However, before entering the medical field, Ross briefly worked as a clerk in Calcutta (in what would today be considered an accounting role) to support himself financially.\n\n### Nobel Prize-Winning Work\nRoss's major contribution to science came from his research on malaria, a disease that had plagued tropical and subtropical regions for centuries. While stationed in Secunderabad (in present-day Telangana, India), he discovered in 1897 that the Anopheles mosquito was the vector responsible for transmitting malaria. This groundbreaking discovery laid the foundation for understanding the disease's life cycle and opened the door for future efforts to control and eradicate malaria.\n\n### Legacy\nRoss's work was pivotal in the field of tropical medicine. For his contributions, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1902, becoming the first British Nobel laureate. His findings significantly reduced the impact of malaria globally and helped save millions of lives over the years.\n\nRoss later returned to the UK, where he continued his research and took up academic positions, including a role at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.

Its origins can be traced back to early Christian philosophy and medieval literature, although the exact phrasing has evolved over time.\n\n### Historical Context:\nThe concept that patience is a moral or virtuous trait has roots in ancient philosophy and religious teachings. **Patience** was considered one of the seven heavenly virtues in Christian theology, derived from the works of early theologians like Saint Augustine and Thomas Aquinas. These virtues were seen as counterpoints to the seven deadly sins and were meant to guide moral behavior. Patience, as a virtue, was often associated with fortitude, humility, and perseverance in the face of difficulty or suffering.\n\nThe specific phrasing, \"patience is a virtue,\" can be traced back to medieval English literature. One of the earliest known appearances of the phrase occurs in \"Piers Plowman,\" a 14th-century allegorical poem by William Langland. In this poem, which is written in Middle English, the idea of patience as a virtue is explored in the context of Christian morals and the pursuit of a righteous life.\n\n### Broader Influence:\nThe idea was later popularized by various writers and thinkers throughout medieval and Renaissance periods. It became a part of common wisdom passed down through generations, often cited in moral or philosophical discussions. Over time, the phrase cemented itself as a proverb, transcending its religious origins and becoming a universal reminder of the value of self-restraint and endurance.\n\n### Modern Usage:\nIn contemporary contexts, \"patience is a virtue\" is used as a reminder to stay calm and composed in situations that require waiting or enduring challenges. While the phrase originated from Christian teachings, it resonates across cultures and philosophies, as patience is universally regarded as a positive and essential quality.\n\nIn summary, the phrase has its roots in early Christian theology and medieval literature, particularly the 14th-century poem *Piers Plowman*. Its enduring popularity reflects the timeless value of patience as a key part of human character and moral behavior.","em":0,"f1":0.2222222222}

","category":"Undetermined lexicons or references","judgment":"underspecified","reasoning":"The request is underspecified because the term \"head of the Spanish Inquisition\" can refer to multiple historical figures depending on the time period. The Spanish Inquisition was a long-running institution with different leaders at different times, and without specifying a particular era or context, the referent remains ambiguous.","model_short_answer":["Tom\u00e1s de Torquemada"],"model_long_answer":"The Spanish Inquisition, established in 1478 by Catholic Monarchs Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, did not have a single head for its entire duration, as it operated for over 350 years (until it was officially abolished in 1834). Instead, it was overseen by a series of **Grand Inquisitors**, who were the leaders of the institution at different times. These individuals were appointed by the Catholic monarchs and later by the Pope. The Grand Inquisitor was the highest authority within the Inquisition, responsible for enforcing Catholic orthodoxy, rooting out heresy, and overseeing the tribunals.\n\n### The First Grand Inquisitor: Tom\u00e1s de Torquemada\nThe most famous (and infamous) head of the Spanish Inquisition was **Tom\u00e1s de Torquemada**, who served as the first Grand Inquisitor from 1483 to 1498. Torquemada is often associated with the harshest and most repressive aspects of the Inquisition. A Dominican friar, he was a staunch advocate of Catholic orthodoxy and played a central role in organizing the structure of the Inquisition. Under his leadership:\n- The Inquisition targeted **Conversos** (Jews and Muslims who had converted to Christianity) suspected of secretly practicing their original faith.\n- The use of torture, confiscation of property, and public executions (such as burning at the stake) became widespread.\n- He supported the **Alhambra Decree** of 1492, which expelled practicing Jews from Spain.\n\n### Other Notable Grand Inquisitors\nAfter Torquemada, the position of Grand Inquisitor continued to be held by powerful church figures. Some of the most prominent include:\n1. **Diego de Deza (1498\u20131507):** Succeeded Torquemada and continued his policies, though he was considered less harsh.\n2. **Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros (1507\u20131517):** A prominent reformer and adviser to the monarchy, he expanded the Inquisition's reach.\n3. **Fernando de Vald\u00e9s (1547\u20131566):** Under his leadership, the Inquisition became a tool for suppressing Protestantism in Spain, as part of the broader Counter-Reformation.\n4. **Pedro Pacheco and others:** Later Grand Inquisitors presided over the Inquisition as it evolved, targeting not only heresy but also Enlightenment ideas.\n\n### Role of the Inquisition\nThe Spanish Inquisition was not an independent institution; it operated under the authority of the Spanish Crown. Its purpose was to ensure that Catholicism remained the dominant religion in Spain, particularly after the Reconquista (the reconquest of Spain from Muslim rule). Over time, it also targeted Protestants, mystics, and individuals accused of witchcraft or blasphemy.\n\n### Abolition of the Inquisition\nThe Spanish Inquisition lost much of its power in the 18th century due to Enlightenment ideas and reforms. It was briefly abolished during the Napoleonic Wars (1808\u20131813), reinstated afterward, and finally abolished permanently in **1834** by Queen Isabella II.\n\nWhile Torquemada is the most infamous figure associated with the Inquisition, it is important to remember that the institution adapted over centuries and was shaped by the political and religious dynamics of the time.","em":0,"f1":0.8571428571}

Without this context, the answer cannot be determined.","model_short_answer":["Amazon Prime Video"],"model_long_answer":"\"Thursday Night Football\" (TNF) has undergone several changes in broadcast arrangements over the years, and as of the 2023 NFL season, it is no longer available on a traditional broadcast TV channel for most games. Instead, **Amazon Prime Video** has exclusive streaming rights to the majority of Thursday Night Football games in the United States. This means that you need an Amazon Prime subscription to watch these games.\n\nHowever, there are a few important details to consider:\n\n### 1. **Local Market Broadcasts**\nWhile Amazon Prime Video is the primary platform for TNF, the games are still simulcast on **local over-the-air (OTA) broadcast stations** in the participating teams' home markets. For example, if the Dallas Cowboys are playing the Philadelphia Eagles on a Thursday night, local TV stations in Dallas and Philadelphia may still broadcast the game on a traditional channel, such as an affiliate of **Fox, CBS, NBC, or ABC**, depending on the agreements in those markets. This ensures that fans in the local markets can watch the game without needing Amazon Prime.\n\n### 2. **Thanksgiving Day and Special TNF Games**\nSome Thursday games, such as the **Thanksgiving Day games**, are not part of Amazon's TNF package. Instead, they air on traditional broadcast networks like **CBS**, **Fox**, or **NBC**, which have long held rights to these holiday matchups. These games are available to anyone with access to those networks, whether through cable, satellite, or an antenna for free OTA broadcasts.\n\n### 3. **How to Watch TNF on Regular TV**\nIf you're looking to watch TNF and you're not in a participating team's local market, you'll need to use Amazon Prime Video. However, if you are in a local market or it's a special holiday game, you can:\n\n- Check your local TV listings to see if the game is airing on a major network affiliate (e.g., Fox, NBC, or CBS).\n- Use an HD antenna to catch the OTA broadcast if it's available in your area.\n\n### Background on TNF's Move to Amazon Prime\nStarting in 2022, Amazon Prime Video became the exclusive home for most TNF games under an 11-year agreement with the NFL. This was a significant shift, as Thursday Night Football had previously aired on networks like **NBC**, **CBS**, **Fox**, and the **NFL Network**. The move to streaming reflects the NFL's growing focus on digital platforms and partnerships with tech companies.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have an Amazon Prime subscription, you could also consider signing up for a free trial during the NFL season or exploring other legal options to stream or watch the games.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date information on which channel or platform is broadcasting a specific Thursday Night Football game, consult the NFL's official schedule or your local TV guide.","em":0,"f1":0.0}
{"question":"which is the default file extension for an audio file in windows media player","short_answers":["Windows Media Video (WMV)","Windows Media Audio (WMA)","Advanced Systems Format (ASF)","Windows Playlist (WPL)"],"long_answer":" Windows Media Player 11 is available for Windows XP and included in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 . The default file formats are Windows Media Video ( WMV ) , Windows Media Audio ( WMA ) , and Advanced Systems Format ( ASF ) , and its own XML based playlist format called Windows Playlist ( WPL ) . The player is also able to utilize a digital rights management service in the form of Windows Media DRM . ","category":"Undetermined standard or preference","judgment":"underspecified","reasoning":"The request is underspecified because the term \"default file extension\" can refer to multiple interpretations: (1) the file format associated with Windows Media Player by default (e.g., .mp3, .wav), (2) the extension used when saving files via the player\u2019s interface, or (3) the extension tied to a specific use case (e.g., streaming, playback). Without clarifying the context or standard, the question lacks specificity.","model_short_answer":[".wma"],"model_long_answer":"The default file extension for an audio file in **Windows Media Player** is typically **.wma** (Windows Media Audio). This is Microsoft's proprietary audio file format, designed to work seamlessly with Windows Media Player. \n\n### Key Details:\n1. **.WMA (Windows Media Audio)**:\n   - This format is highly compatible with Windows Media Player.\n   - It was developed by Microsoft as a competitor to MP3 and other audio formats.\n   - WMA files often use higher compression, which allows for smaller file sizes without significantly reducing audio quality.\n\n2. **Support for Other Audio File Formats**:\n   While .wma is the default, Windows Media Player also supports other common audio formats, such as:\n   - **.MP3** (MPEG Audio Layer III) - A popular, widely used format for digital audio.\n   - **.WAV** (Waveform Audio File Format) - An uncompressed audio format that provides high-quality audio.\n   - **.AAC** (Advanced Audio Coding) - Commonly used in iTunes and Apple Music.\n   - **.FLAC** (Free Lossless Audio Codec) - A high-quality lossless format, though not always natively supported in older versions of Windows Media Player.\n\n3. **Ripping CDs with Windows Media Player**:\n   If you use Windows Media Player to rip audio CDs, the program allows you to choose the output format (e.g., .wma, .mp3, .wav). By default, the ripped files are often saved as .wma unless you change the settings.\n\n4. **Changing File Format Settings**:\n   You can configure the default file format for ripping or playback in Windows Media Player by navigating to:\n   - **Tools \u2192 Options \u2192 Rip Music Tab** (for ripping settings).\n   - This gives you the ability to select your preferred format and adjust the audio quality.\n\nIn summary, while .wma is the default file extension specific to Windows Media Player, the software supports a broad range of audio formats, ensuring compatibility with most types of audio files.","em":0,"f1":0.4}

Because of this , Scott resigns from his position on the student council . It turns out that a lot of other members also resigned including the president meaning Julia who happened to have the 2nd most amount of votes is now president .

Beerus demands that Goku takes responsibility for asking Zen\u014d - sama to hold the tournament in the first place . Goku declares that he will defeat any opponent he faces . The Great Priest also reveals that Universes 7 and 9 are to have a smaller exhibition tournament for Future Zen\u014d - sama 's benefit . Each universe is to name three fighters .

As Roh ( \u30ed\u30a6 , R\u014d ) , the Supreme Kai of Universe 9 , claims victory , Majin Buu emerges with a hole in his stomach , but he is otherwise unmoved . Basil and Roh are shocked to see this . Mr. Satan is injured during the attack . He tells Majin Buu to beat Basil before falling unconscious . This enrages Majin Buu to the point , where he effortlessly beats Basil and knocks him out of the ring . However , since neither Zen\u014d - sama is satisfied with the fight , Basil is allowed to get back into the ring . Roh gives Basil a drug that makes him far more powerful . Although Beerus demands that Basil is disqualified for obvious cheating , Zen\u014d - sama is entertained by this and allows the fight to continue . The Great Priest announces that the rules will be improvised as the tournament goes along . Basil overpowers Majin Buu and seemingly beats him , which causes Roh to prematurely gloat about the superiority of Universe 9 . However , Majin Buu emerges unscathed and launches a full power attack at Basil . This knocks him out and clinches Universe 7 the victory .

Shin offers Gohan a Senzu bean to cure the poison , but Gohan refuses and says he wants to fight with his strength alone . Unable to see , Gohan uses his other senses to track Lavender and scores several blows . Lavender counters by levitating , which eliminates the sound of his footsteps . Gohan responds by powering up to Super Saiyan and bouncing his own ki off of Lavender 's body , which uses it as a kind of active radar . Powering up also causes the poison to spread rapidly through Gohan 's body . Lavender mounts a comeback . In desperation , Gohan grabs hold of Lavender and launches a kamikaze attack . He drives both of their bodies into the ring at high speed . Lavender is knocked out , but Gohan is so weakened by the poison that he can not continue . With both fighters down , the match is declared a tie . After Goku feeds Gohan a Senzu bean , the Great Priest announces to those in attendance that all universes that lose the Tournament of Power will be erased with their respective gods as well . However , Universes 1 , 5 , 8 , and 12 will be exempt from erasure as will the Angels from all universes because their inhabitants are particularly strong . Zeno - sama had long believed that there were too many universes . He was planning to erase most of them anyway , but the tournament will afford one of the weaker universes the chance to be spared .

Bergamo pleads with Zen\u014d - sama to rescind the rule that the universes that lose the Tournament of Power be erased . Zen\u014d - sama agrees on the condition that Bergamo beats Goku in an all out battle . Great Priest states that if Goku holds back to cancel the erasure , Zen\u014d - sama will immediately erase all of the universes . Both Goku and Bergamo agree to the terms . When the fight begins , Bergamo invites Goku to hit him and leaves himself exposed . Goku obliges and strikes Bergamo several times , but Bergamo absorbs the energy of Goku 's attacks . He grows stronger and physically larger . Goku continues to attack , which causes Bergamo to grow so large that the ring begins to buckle under his weight . Goku transforms to Super Saiyan Blue , which shocks the gods and quickly overwhelms Bergamo with a Kaioken powered Kamehameha . Bergamo claims every universe participating in the Tournament of Power will seek vengeance on Goku for making them face erasure , but Goku relishes the idea of such a challenge . The Zen Exhibition Match comes to a close and the Tournament of Power will soon begin . The universe with the most fighters remaining or the last fighter standing will be declared the winner . Suddenly , a mysterious fighter from Universe 11 named Toppo ( \u30c8\u30c3\u30dd ) appears and challenges Goku to a battle .

Toppo quickly gains the upper hand and dislocates Goku 's shoulder . Goku responds by attacking with a flurry of blows , but Toppo manages to grab Goku in a powerful bear hug . He begins squeezing the life out of Goku , which forces Goku to turn Super Saiyan Blue to escape . Goku gains the upper hand in this form and damages Toppo with a Kamehameha . Just as the two power up even more , the Great Priest puts an end to the fight . As Toppo leaves , he reveals to Goku that Universe 11 has a warrior even stronger than him named Jiren ( \u30b8\u30ec\u30f3 ) . The Great Priest begins creating a martial arts arena suitable for the Tournament of Power .

They discuss who should be on the team . Goku immediately suggests Monaka , but Beerus tells him that Monaka is sick and can not participate . Goku and Gohan agree on Vegeta , Piccolo , Krillin , Master Roshi , No. 18 , and No. 17 , which would bring the total number of fighters up to nine . Trunks and Goten are ruled out due to their inexperience . They proceed to ask Vegeta , who has been thinking of a name for his second child . Vegeta refuses to participate . He says he will not fight , while Bulma is pregnant . Whis uses his time warping ability to birth the baby sooner than expected in order to get Vegeta to agree to the fight . Everyone celebrates the baby 's birth . Trunks is slightly disappointed he has a sister because he wanted to train with a younger brother .

The practice of issuing coins with the names or images of rulers marked a significant development in the history of coinage and is often associated with asserting royal authority and identity.\n\n### Early Coinage in General\nCoinage as a form of currency first appeared in the ancient kingdom of Lydia (in what is now Turkey) around the 7th century BCE. The Lydian king **Alyattes (circa 610\u2013560 BCE)** is credited with issuing some of the first standardized coins made from electrum, a naturally occurring alloy of gold and silver. However, these early coins did not bear the king's name or image; instead, they featured simple designs, such as symbols or animals, like a lion.\n\n### First Coins Bearing a King's Name\nThe first known rulers to issue coins specifically bearing their names or inscriptions were **Greek and Persian kings**. Here's a breakdown:\n\n#### 1. **King Achaemenid Darius I (Persian Empire)**\n   - **Time Period**: 522\u2013486 BCE\n   - **Details**: Darius I of Persia issued gold coins known as **darics** and silver coins called **sigloi**. While these coins didn't directly bear his name in an alphabetic script, they featured a stylized image of the king as a warrior holding a bow and spear, symbolizing his authority and divine right to rule. This coinage is among the first to depict the ruler in some form.\n\n#### 2. **Alexander the Great (Greek King)**\n   - **Time Period**: Reign from 336\u2013323 BCE\n   - **Details**: Alexander the Great is often credited with popularizing coins that prominently featured the image of the ruler. After his conquest of the Persian Empire, Alexander issued coins bearing images of himself as a god-like figure, often depicted with the horns of Zeus-Ammon, symbolizing his divine status. Some coins also bore inscriptions or symbols indicating his name.\n\n#### 3. **King Lysimachus (Successor of Alexander the Great)**\n   - **Time Period**: Reign from 306\u2013281 BCE\n   - **Details**: Lysimachus, one of Alexander's successors (diadochi), was among the first to explicitly feature his name on coins alongside his image. His coins often portrayed Alexander the Great on one side and himself on the other, with inscriptions identifying him as the ruler.\n\n### Broader Context\nThe tradition of depicting rulers' names and images on coins spread widely in the Hellenistic world after Alexander the Great. It became a standard practice in the Roman Empire as well, where emperors such as Julius Caesar and Augustus issued coins bearing their names and portraits. This practice was a powerful political tool, reinforcing the ruler's legitimacy and authority across vast territories.\n\nIn summary, while early coinage existed in places like Lydia and ancient China, the first kings to prominently feature their names or images on coins were likely Persian kings like Darius I and Greek rulers like Alexander the Great and his successors. This practice marked a turning point in the use of coinage as a medium for political propaganda and royal identity.","em":0,"f1":0.2}

Near the end of his career , he provided voices for the animated features A Bug 's Life and Toy Story 2 .

Without specifying which version is intended, the referent remains ambiguous.","model_short_answer":["Jonathan Harris"],"model_long_answer":"In the original 1965\u20131968 television series *Lost in Space*, the character of Dr. Zachary Smith was portrayed by **Jonathan Harris**. Harris\u2019s performance as Dr. Smith became iconic, as he transformed the character from a straightforward villain into a more comedic, cowardly, and self-serving figure. His portrayal of Dr. Smith was instrumental in shaping the tone of the series, especially as it evolved from a serious science fiction show to a campy, family-oriented adventure.\n\nDr. Smith was initially written as a saboteur who caused the Robinson family's spaceship, the Jupiter 2, to veer off course and become \"lost in space.\" However, Harris\u2019s over-the-top and flamboyant performance added humor and dimension to the character, making him one of the most memorable parts of the show. His catchphrases, such as calling the Robot \"a bubble-headed booby,\" became fan favorites.\n\n### Other Portrayals of Dr. Smith:\n1. **Gary Oldman** played Dr. Smith in the 1998 film adaptation of *Lost in Space*. In this version, the character was more menacing and closer to his villainous roots, though the film also gave the character a sci-fi twist by transforming him into a spider-like creature as part of the plot.\n\n2. **Parker Posey** portrayed a gender-swapped version of the character, June Harris (posing as \"Dr. Smith\"), in the 2018 Netflix reboot of *Lost in Space*. This reimagined version of the character retained the manipulative and self-serving traits of the original Dr. Smith but was given a fresh, modern interpretation.\n\nJonathan Harris\u2019s original portrayal remains one of the defining aspects of the classic series, with his larger-than-life personality and humorous cowardice making Dr. Smith both infuriating and endearing to audiences.","em":1,"f1":1.0}

While the pranks can last all day in many places, there is an old tradition, particularly in the United Kingdom and some Commonwealth countries, that stipulates April Fools' shenanigans are supposed to end at **noon**. After midday, anyone who continues to play pranks is considered the \"fool\" themselves. \n\nThis specific custom isn't universally observed, as in many other countries and cultures, the pranks and jokes may continue throughout the entire day.\n\n### Historical Context of the Noon Rule\nThe origins of this \"end by noon\" tradition are unclear, but it is thought to tie into the nature of April Fools' Day as a \"light-hearted\" celebration. By limiting the pranks to the morning, it may have been a way to keep the mischief brief and prevent it from interfering with more serious tasks or responsibilities later in the day. Over time, though, this rule has faded in many regions, and all-day pranking has become more common.\n\n### April Fools' Traditions Around the World\n- In **France** and **Italy**, April Fools' Day is known as \"Poisson d'Avril\" (April Fish), where the pranks often involve attaching a paper fish to someone's back.\n- In **Scotland**, a similar tradition called \"Huntigowk Day\" historically focused on sending people on wild goose chases.\n- In the **United States** and many other countries, there is no formal rule about pranking ending at noon, and jokes can last all day.\n\nSo, if you're in a region where the \"noon rule\" is still observed, it's best to wrap up your pranks by midday to avoid being labeled the fool yourself!","em":0,"f1":0.1333333333}

It focuses on 14 events or \"stations\" that represent significant moments from Jesus' condemnation by Pontius Pilate to His crucifixion and burial. The origins of the Stations of the Cross lie in the early Christian veneration of the places in Jerusalem associated with Jesus' passion and death, evolving over centuries into the form we recognize today.\n\n### Early Origins in Jerusalem\nThe tradition of retracing Jesus' steps during His Passion dates back to the early Christian period. After the legalization of Christianity in 313 CE under Emperor Constantine, Jerusalem became a major pilgrimage destination. Devout Christians would visit the actual sites where Jesus was believed to have suffered and died. These locations included the praetorium (where Jesus was condemned), the path to Golgotha, and the tomb where He was buried. By the 4th century, these holy sites were marked and venerated, with pilgrims following a route that mirrored Jesus' journey.\n\nOne of the earliest references to this practice comes from the account of Egeria, a 4th-century Christian pilgrim. In her travel diary, she describes how Christians in Jerusalem would walk from Gethsemane to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre (believed to encompass both Golgotha and the tomb) during Holy Week, stopping at various points to remember events of the Passion.\n\n### Development in the Middle Ages\nDuring the Crusades (11th\u201313th centuries), pilgrimage to the Holy Land became more popular among Western Christians. However, as travel to Jerusalem became dangerous and impractical due to political conflict in the region, an alternative practice developed in Europe. Instead of traveling to the Holy Land, Christians began to create symbolic representations of the Way of the Cross in their own cities and churches. These included tableaux, sculptures, or paintings depicting the key moments of Jesus' Passion.\n\nThe Franciscans, who were granted custody of Christian holy sites in the Holy Land in 1342 by the Pope, played a significant role in spreading the devotion. They helped formalize and popularize the practice of the Stations of the Cross, bringing the tradition to Europe and encouraging the establishment of replicas of the \"Via Dolorosa,\" the actual path in Jerusalem believed to be the route Jesus walked.\n\n### The Number of Stations\nInitially, the number of stations was not fixed. Different traditions varied in the moments they commemorated, ranging from 5 to 37 events. The current form of 14 stations became standardized in the 17th century, largely due to the efforts of the Franciscans. Pope Clement XII officially approved the 14 stations in 1731, granting all Franciscan churches the right to erect Stations of the Cross. This practice spread widely, and the devotion became a staple of Catholic piety, especially during Lent and Holy Week.\n\n### The Stations of the Cross Today\nThe 14 traditional stations include both biblical events (e.g., Jesus being condemned, falling under the weight of the cross, meeting His mother) and non-biblical ones (e.g., Veronica wiping Jesus' face). In recent decades, some have proposed an alternative set of \"Scriptural Stations of the Cross,\" based solely on events explicitly mentioned in the Gospels, an initiative supported by Pope John Paul II.\n\nThe Stations of the Cross continues to hold deep spiritual significance for Christians, serving as a way to meditate on Jesus' suffering, death, and ultimate sacrifice for humanity. Today, it is a central devotional practice during Lent, especially on Good Friday, and is often accompanied by prayers and reflections.","em":0,"f1":0.1690140845}

Title   Directed by   Written by   Original air date   U.S. viewers ( millions )       `` Burnt Food ''   Seth Gordon   David Shore   September 25 , 2017 ( 2017 - 09 - 25 )   11.22     On the way to begin his surgical residency at San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital , Dr. Shaun Murphy witnesses an airport sign fall and shatter glass onto a young boy . Another doctor is first on the scene and begins applying pressure to the child 's neck . Shaun tells him that he 's pressing on the wrong part of the neck for a child . With his unique ability to visualize the internal body and using improvised methods and tools , Shaun is able to stabilize the boy . On the way to the hospital , Shaun notices that the boy 's vitals have changed . Hospital staff are alerted to the arrival of the boy . Shaun tries to tell the doctors about the boy 's vitals , stating that he needs an echo - cardiogram . The doctors disagree and begin surgery . While operating , something goes wrong and Claire Browne , a surgical resident , recalls Shaun mentioning an echo . Thanks to Shaun 's diagnosis , the boy 's life is saved . Meanwhile , in a hospital board meeting , Dr. Aaron Glassman , president of the hospital , tries to convince the board to hire Shaun , despite his autism . Flashbacks give us a picture of Shaun 's childhood and his motivation for becoming a doctor .       `` Mount Rushmore ''   Mike Listo   David Shore   October 2 , 2017 ( 2017 - 10 - 02 )   10.93     Dr. Melendez is doing rounds with Dr. Browne and Dr. Kalu . Melendez calls out Shaun for arriving late on his first full day . A middle aged woman is brought into the ER with abdominal pain . Shaun immediately diagnoses a malignant tumor . Melendez assigns Browne as his number two for the surgery while giving Shaun `` scut work '' - all the work that residents hate doing . On the operating table , the doctors find the tumor is much bigger than expected and has encased all of her arteries . Looking at biopsy results , the residents find out that she is suffering from leiomyosarcoma , making surgery seemingly impossible . Shaun 's ability to visualize the internal organs allows him to figure out that removing one of her kidneys would allow a better look , enough to view and possibly remove the mass . To Browne 's dismay , Kalu suggests Shaun 's idea to Melendez , getting the credit for the idea . Meanwhile , Shaun 's attention to detail in his scut work gets him into trouble . Instead of releasing patients ready for discharge , Shaun rechecks them and orders additional tests . Upon learning this , Melendez assigns Nurse Freydey as Shaun 's `` boss '' for the day . Later , after rechecking a discharged young girl 's test results , Shaun races to her home . The parents are annoyed that he 's bothering them after midnight and at first refuse to let him in . Shaun insists he will not leave before seeing their daughter . His diagnosis is correct and they must rush her to the hospital for surgery to save her life .       `` Oliver ''   John Dahl   Bill Rotko   October 9 , 2017 ( 2017 - 10 - 09 )   10.69     Shaun and Claire fly to San Francisco Municipal Hospital to get a patient a liver . They ca n't fly on their way back due to fog and are forced to use a police escort . Problems keep coming one after the other ; first , the liver 's temperature went above the required maximum , forcing them to have a sudden stop at a local store , where they cool it by submerging it in slush . As they proceed with their journey , Shaun discovers that the liver has a clot . With only two hours of viability left , the duo decide to perform an operation on the way in order to remove the clot and flash the left lobe , to protect it from the ice bath . Back at San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital , Chuck , the recipient of the liver , is discovered to have alcohol in his system ; a likelihood that he might be moved to the bottom of the list . Chuck later confesses that he actually took a drink on his daughter 's graduation . In order to protect its reputation and the future patients , the hospital decides to move Chuck to the bottom of the list . To their dismay , Shaun and Claire arrive back , only to find out that the liver has to be taken to another patient in another hospital .       `` Pipes ''   Steven DePaul   Thomas L. Moran   October 16 , 2017 ( 2017 - 10 - 16 )   10.60     Through an ultrasound , an expectant woman 's baby is diagnosed with a tumor at his tail bone ; the mom has Antiphospholipid syndrome , making surgery a high risk . Dr. Melendez suggests termination of the pregnancy but Shaun interjects by suggesting clotting pre-operatively with an infusion of unfractionated heparin . Things are further complicated when the woman and eventually her husband refuse to terminate the baby . During surgery , there is a complication ; a blood clot at the artery in her heart . Dr. Kalu has an idea that they should stop her heart and put her on a bypass machine for the duration of the surgery ; that way she wo n't have an heart attack , which turns out to be successful and the doctors reveal she 's carrying a baby boy . With a patient needing a boil lanced , Dr. Melendez assigns Shaun and Dr. Browne on the case , as a punishment for being late . The patient turns out to be a pornographic actress ; she does n't have a boil but a large Bartholin gland abscess and they prep her for surgery the following day . They successfully drain the abscess but discover that she has a Perineal myoma underneath . The fibroid tumor is wrapped around the nerve that facilitates feeling in her genitals . Therefore , the doctors have to remove the tumor but they have to sever the nerve ; hence , losing all feeling in her genitals . Shaun comes up the idea of grafting the distal end of the pudendal nerve to the branch of the femoral cutaneous nerve from her inner thigh ; this will lead to her losing feeling in her thigh while preserving feeling in her genitals .     5   `` Point Three Percent ''   Larry Teng   David Hoselton   October 23 , 2017 ( 2017 - 10 - 23 )   10.39     Shaun notices a young boy with an indubitable resemblance to his deceased brother Steve , forming a bond with him . The boy 's name is actually Evan and was brought to the hospital by his parents for reportedly breaking an arm ; unbeknownst to Evan , he is in fact suffering from stage 4 Osteosarcoma . Shaun later suspects that he might have been misdiagnosed with cancer but indeed was suffering from Langerhans cell histiocytosis . In order not to give both Evan and his parents false hopes , Shaun decides to lie , attempting to perform a bone marrow aspiration , but he is caught red - handed by the parents . Subsequently , Evan starts coughing out blood , sending him to the OR . While on the operating table , Dr. Neil Menendez and Dr. Claire Browne discover that the cancer had metastasized , undoubtable proof that he is indeed suffering with terminal cancer . The other doctors are trying to find a prognosis of a 66 - year old man , brought to the hospital by his estranged son , with an allergy causing him to have convulsions . Dr. Browne later finds out that the man is suffering from Echinococcus , a cyst form of tapeworms . Saddened by Evan 's fate , which Evan has in fact known about the whole time , Shaun reads Evan the final few pages of To Kill a Mockingbird , a book of Steve 's that he never finished reading before he died .     6   `` Not Fake ''   Michael Patrick Jann   Simran Baidwan   October 30 , 2017 ( 2017 - 10 - 30 )   10.60     Shaun and the rest of the residents are working the graveyard shift when numerous casualties from a wedding bus crash come in . Among the victims are a woman with severe , visible burns , on whom Dr. Kalu tries an experimental procedure , and a young man with a damaged leg who can either have it amputated , or have an artificial bone inserted . The relative newness of the latter procedure causes a conflict between the man 's parent and his soon - to - be bride .     7   `` 22 Steps ''   David Straiton   Johanna Lee   November 13 , 2017 ( 2017 - 11 - 13 )   10.14     Shaun encounters Liam , an autistic patient brought in to San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital . Having to face prejudice from the young man 's parents , Dr. Melendez defends him for the first time and acknowledges his exceptional abilities . On Dr. Glassman 's directive , Claire continues her therapy sessions in order to curb her guilt over the death of a patient she inadvertently caused in the previous episode . On the other hand , Dr. Kalu gets a 73 - year - old man with severe chest pains thus needing urgent medical attention and a pacemaker but his desire is to die ; in order to give him hope on life , Dr. Kalu does everything he can to have him accept treatment , to no avail in which the latter finally lets him sign the DNR .     8   `` Apple ''   Nestor Carbonell   David Renaud   November 20 , 2017 ( 2017 - 11 - 20 )   9.97     While shopping at a grocery mart for apples , a robbery takes place . With Shaun 's communication limitations , he puts the lives of two customers on a first date at risk , leading to a young woman getting shot . Shaun 's neighbor Lea hugs him after he admits that he made a mistake with someone getting hurt . During surgery , Dr. Lim questions Claire 's ability to not let her emotions get the better of her because of a racist patient . This leads to a fight between the two with Dr. Lim ordering Claire to leave the operating room . Claire puts her emotions in check to save the life of the racist patient much to the satisfaction and delight of Dr. Lim .     9   `` Intangibles ''   Bronwen Hughes   Karen Struck   November 27 , 2017 ( 2017 - 11 - 27 )   9.25     The team takes on the case of a young boy from the Congo who has severe congenital heart anomalies ; Murphy 's latest encounter with his neighbor Lea has him confused . He takes flirting lessons from Dr. Browne and notes and charts what he sees in regards to the `` flirting trifecta '' .

December 4 , 2017 ( 2017 - 12 - 04 )   9.03     In Dr. Glassman 's office , Shaun sees the therapist hired to help him with in - home visits . He reluctantly agrees to meet with her , but changes his mind after meeting a new patient , Bobby Ato , who convinces him to stop letting people tell him what he can and ca n't do . Ato is a champion gamer , who is in St. Bonaventure for surgery to repair torn ligaments in his left arm . After an MRI , cancer is discovered , making an additional surgery much more complicated and results in doubt . Shaun avoids meeting with his therapist by sleeping in the hospital custodian 's closet at night . Finally , a confrontation with Glassman in the hospital lobby leads to Shaun having a meltdown , causing him to strike Glassman in the face and run out of the hospital . Meanwhile , Claire runs into an uncomfortable situation with a new doctor , Dr. Matt Coyle , who makes unwanted sexual advances toward her . After telling Jared about this , he confronts the doctor and physically threatens him . As a result , Jared is fired . Later , Dr. Melendez and Jessica have dinner with her father .

{"question":"where do royal families get their money from","short_answers":["the hereditary revenues of the Crown"],"long_answer":" The British royal family is financed by the hereditary revenues of the Crown . The British Parliament uses a percentage of the Crown Estate , a part of the Crown 's hereditary revenues belonging to the sovereign that is placed at the disposal of the House of Commons , to meet the costs of the sovereign 's official expenditures . This includes the costs of the upkeep of the various royal residences , staffing , travel and state visits , public engagements , and official entertainment . Other sources of income include revenues from the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall , a parliamentary annuity , and income from private investments . The Keeper of the Privy Purse is Head of the Privy Purse and Treasurer 's Office and has overall responsibility for the management of the sovereign 's financial affairs . ","category":"Undetermined lexicons or references","judgment":"underspecified","reasoning":"The request is underspecified because the term \"royal families\" is broad and can refer to multiple parallel entities (e.g., British, Spanish, Japanese, etc.), each with distinct financial sources. Without specifying which royal family is intended, the answer depends on context, making the referent ambiguous. Additionally, the question lacks clarity on whether it refers to historical funding, current income streams, or specific mechanisms like the Crown Estate, investments, or other assets.","model_short_answer":["- Inherited wealth and assets  \n- Government funding or allowances  \n- Private investments and businesses  \n- Tourism and public events  \n- Land ownership and property rentals"],"model_long_answer":"Royal families typically derive their wealth and income from a combination of public funding, private assets, investments, and inherited wealth. The structure of their finances can vary significantly depending on the country, their role in the government, and the historical context. Below is a detailed explanation of how royal families sustain their wealth, with examples from prominent monarchies:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Public Funding**\nIn many constitutional monarchies, royal families receive funding from the state to support their official duties, maintain palaces, and host state events. This funding is often controversial because it comes from taxpayer money, but it usually reflects the monarchy's symbolic role in representing the country. The form and amount of public funding vary:\n\n- **United Kingdom**: The British royal family receives public funding through the \"Sovereign Grant.\" This grant is calculated as a percentage (currently 25%) of the profits generated by the Crown Estate, a portfolio of land and assets owned by the monarchy but managed independently. In 2022, the Sovereign Grant amounted to \u00a386.3 million. This money supports the family's official duties, travel, and upkeep of royal residences.\n  \n- **Netherlands**: The Dutch royal family receives an annual stipend from the government, which is divided into allowances for the monarch and other senior members. In 2023, King Willem-Alexander's annual income (including personal and official expenses) was approximately \u20ac6 million.\n\n- **Sweden**: The Swedish royal family receives funding from the state, specifically for the upkeep of royal palaces and the costs of official events. The \"appanage,\" or annual allocation, is used for these purposes but cannot be used for personal expenses.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Private Wealth and Assets**\nRoyal families often own private estates, investments, and businesses that generate income. These assets are distinct from assets held by the state (e.g., palaces or treasures) and are typically passed down through generations.\n\n- **British Royal Family**: The Windsors have significant private wealth. Queen Elizabeth II personally owned estates like Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle, as well as a valuable private art collection and investment portfolios. King Charles III also has access to the Duchy of Cornwall (valued at over \u00a31 billion), a private estate that generates millions annually.\n\n- **Monaco**: The Grimaldi family in Monaco owns extensive real estate in the principality, which generates substantial rental income. They also have personal investments and wealth built over centuries.\n\n- **Saudi Arabia**: The Saudi royal family, the House of Saud, derives enormous wealth from the country's oil reserves. As the ruling family of Saudi Arabia, they control the state-owned oil company, Saudi Aramco, one of the most profitable companies in the world. This makes them one of the wealthiest royal families globally, with an estimated collective wealth of over $1 trillion.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Historic Land and Property Ownership**\nMany royal families own vast tracts of land, which can provide rental income or value appreciation over time. Some of these lands are privately owned, while others are held in trust or on behalf of the nation.\n\n- **Crown Estate (UK)**: While the Crown Estate technically belongs to the reigning monarch, it is managed independently, and its profits go to the UK Treasury. In exchange, the monarchy receives the Sovereign Grant. The estate includes prime real estate in London, wind farms, and agricultural land.\n\n- **Norway**: The Norwegian royal family owns private properties, including summer homes and estates, which are not linked to their official roles.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Tourism and Merchandise**\nRoyal families are often significant contributors to tourism revenue, particularly in countries where the monarchy is a key part of national identity. While royal families themselves may not directly profit from ticket sales at landmarks like Buckingham Palace or the Palace of Versailles, the popularity of monarchy-related events and memorabilia can indirectly support their finances.\n\n- **UK Example**: The royal family's association with iconic landmarks like Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, and the Tower of London attracts millions of tourists annually, contributing billions to the UK economy. Some of the revenue generated from ticket sales and merchandise supports royal maintenance costs.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Investment Portfolios**\nRoyal families often have diversified investment portfolios, including stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments, which provide income.\n\n- **Queen Elizabeth II** reportedly had a private investment portfolio worth hundreds of millions of pounds, which generated income through dividends and capital gains.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Inheritance**\nAs monarchies are centuries-old institutions, royal families have accumulated substantial fortunes over generations. These include not only money but also valuable art collections, jewelry, and antiques.\n\n- **The British Royal Collection**: This includes thousands of artworks, rare books, and historical artifacts. While the collection is technically held in trust for the nation, its value (estimated to be in the billions) contributes to the prestige and wealth of the monarchy.\n\n- **Jewelry and Crown Jewels**: Many royal families possess priceless jewelry and regalia. The British Crown Jewels, for example, are part of the national heritage but are used exclusively by the royal family.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Personal Businesses**\nSome royal family members engage in private business ventures or have careers outside their royal duties.\n\n- **Duchy of Cornwall**: Managed by the Prince of Wales (currently Prince William), this estate includes commercial and agricultural properties, generating substantial private income.\n  \n- **Jordan's Royal Family**: The Jordanian monarchy is involved in various private economic ventures, including investments in technology and tourism.\n\n---\n\n### Controversies and Criticism\nThe financing of royal families often sparks debate. Critics argue that public funding for monarchies is outdated or excessive, particularly during times of economic hardship.
