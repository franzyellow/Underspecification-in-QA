{"question":"what stage of the star life cycle is the sun in","short_answers":["about halfway through its main-sequence stage"],"long_answer":" The Sun is about halfway through its main - sequence stage , during which nuclear fusion reactions in its core fuse hydrogen into helium . Each second , more than four million tonnes of matter are converted into energy within the Sun 's core , producing neutrinos and solar radiation . At this rate , the Sun has so far converted around 100 times the mass of Earth into energy , about 0.03 % of the total mass of the Sun . The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 billion years as a main - sequence star . The Sun is gradually becoming hotter during its time on the main sequence , because the helium atoms in the core occupy less volume than the hydrogen atoms that were fused . The core is therefore shrinking , allowing the outer layers of the Sun to move closer to the centre and experience a stronger gravitational force , according to the inverse - square law . This stronger force increases the pressure on the core , which is resisted by a gradual increase in the rate at which fusion occurs . This process speeds up as the core gradually becomes denser . It is estimated that the Sun has become 30 % brighter in the last 4.5 billion years . At present , it is increasing in brightness by about 1 % every 100 million years .

{"question":"where is the oldest civilization known to man","short_answers":["Mesopotamia"],"long_answer":" Around 10,200 BC the first fully developed Neolithic cultures belonging to the phases Pre-Pottery Neolithic A ( PPNA ) and Pre-Pottery Neolithic B ( 7600 to 6000 BC ) appeared in the fertile crescent and from there spread eastwards and westwards . One of the most notable PPNA settlements is Jericho in the Levant region , thought to be the world 's first town ( settled around 8500 BC and fortified around 6800 BC ) . In Mesopotamia , the convergence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers produced rich fertile soil and a supply of water for irrigation . The civilizations that emerged around these rivers are among the earliest known non-nomadic agrarian societies . It is because of this that the fertile crescent region , and Mesopotamia in particular , are often referred to as the cradle of civilization . The period known as the Ubaid period ( c. 6500 to 3800 BC ) is the earliest known period on the alluvial plain , although it is likely earlier periods exist obscured under the alluvium . It was during the Ubaid period that the movement towards urbanization began . Agriculture and animal husbandry were widely practiced in sedentary communities , particularly in Northern Mesopotamia , and intensive irrigated hydraulic agriculture began to be practiced in the south . Eridu is the oldest Sumerian site settled during this period , around 5300 BC , and the city of Ur also first dates to the end of this period . In the south , the Ubaid period had a very long duration from around 6500 to 3800 BC ; when it is replaced by the Uruk period .

{"question":"american horror story freak show girl kidnapped by clown","short_answers":["Bonnie Lipton (portrayed by Skyler Samuels)"],"long_answer":"  Twisty the Clown ( portrayed by John Carroll Lynch ) originally was a slow - witted but gentle clown at a freak show in 1943 . Jealous of his popularity , the freaks of the carnival spread rumors that he was a child molester and drove him away . With nowhere else to go , he returned home to Jupiter , Florida , only to find that his mother had died . After failing to support himself by selling toys made of junk to a local toy store , Twisty attempted suicide by putting a shotgun in his mouth . However , the attempt failed -- he succeeded only in mutilating his lower jaw -- and he later began to wear a grinning mask over the lower part of his face . Twisty then tried to perform as a clown at Elsa 's freak show , but was turned away . Twisty then snapped and went on a killing spree , abducting children to be his audience , while murdering their `` mean '' parents . He kidnaps Corey Bachman and murders his parents , after kidnapping Bonnie Lipton to serve as his audience 's babysitter . Gloria hires Twisty to entertain Dandy , who becomes his accomplice . Twisty and Dandy hold a magic show on Halloween , before Jimmy knocks Dandy unconscious and Maggie gets Corey and Bonnie to safety . Twisty then knocks Jimmy out before encountering Edward Mordrake , who was attracted by the noise of the clown 's performance . Twisty tells Mordrake his story , and Mordrake deems the clown suitable to be in his entourage of damned souls and kills him . When Elsa summons Mordrake in 1962 , Twisty appears alongside the other freaks and comforts her in her last moments . According to director Ryan Murphy , Lynch was so terrifying as this character that `` half the time , almost a third of the crew left the set when they shot his scenes because they were afraid of him . '' In Cult , a comic book detailing a fictionalized version of Twisty is owned by Oz Mayfair - Richards .   Bonnie Lipton ( portrayed by Skyler Samuels ) is a young girl who is kidnapped by Twisty , after Twisty murders her boyfriend Troy . She attacks Twisty and attempts to escape with Corey , but is dragged back to him by Dandy . She escapes Twisty with the help of Jimmy and Maggie in `` Edward Mordrake ( Part 2 ) '' .

In `` Pink Cupcakes '' , she calls Gloria concerning her mother and why she has n't been returning her calls . The conversation turns strange and Regina feels uncomfortable and hangs up , wary of what happened . She turns up at the Mott Manor in `` Blood Bath '' , very suspicious of where her mother is . She threatens to call the police if she does n't see her mother soon . In `` Tupperware Party Massacre '' , Dandy admits to the murder of Dora and lets Regina escape unharmed , despite her refusal to take a blood bath with him . Upon returning with police detective Jack Colquitt , Dandy admits to the murders and boasts about his family 's wealth , buying off Colquitt for a million dollars . Regina is killed when Dandy orders Colquitt to shoot and bury her .   Dora Ross ( portrayed by Patti LaBelle ) is a local townswoman who begins to discover secrets about Dandy . She is the mother of Regina and the put - upon maid to Gloria Mott . In `` Massacres and Matinees '' , she reveals to Gloria that she found dissected animal parts behind the shed , implying they belong to Dandy . She dislikes Dandy 's spoiled attitude and did n't get scared of him when he tried to kill her . In `` Edward Mordrake ( Part 2 ) '' , she dies when Dandy slashes her throat and Gloria helps bury her in their backyard .   Paul ( portrayed by Mat Fraser ) also known as Paul The Illustrated Seal is a performer in the freak show , who was born with phocomelia of both arms . In `` Edward Mordrake ( Part 2 ) '' , he tells Mordrake that he immigrated to the United States from Britain to be in show business . However , he arrived during the Great Depression . In an act of despair , he tattooed his whole body except his face , because he believed that it would have been considered handsome and loveable if it was n't on a freak . It is revealed that he is not only Elsa 's secret lover , but that of Penny too , his true love . He confronts Elsa in `` Bullseye '' about the recent disappearance of Bette and Dot , and she in turn snaps at him for his relationship with Penny . She later becomes angry about a public confrontation with the rest of the troupe and demands one of them place themselves on the spinning wheel , to prove their trust of her . Paul volunteers and it is assumed she purposely threw the last knife into his gut , injuring him badly , leaving him bed ridden . He is then shocked and guilt - stricken later on in `` Test of Strength '' over Penny 's mutilation .

Initially , Eve is somewhat quiet and even - tempered , but in `` Test of Strength '' , Dell attempts to murder her in her caravan . Afraid that he is attempting to rape her , Eve defends herself by savagely beating him and throws him out . She goes to Ethel where she cares for her bruised hand . She and the other women of the freak show then plot to kill Dell once and for all . In `` Curtain Call '' , she is the last freak to be killed by Dandy after she tries to overpower him in Desiree 's caravan . She and the other freaks appear when Elsa joins the freak show in the afterlife .   Mahadevi Patel ( portrayed by Jyoti Amge ) also known as Ma Petite , is a performer in the freak show , who also serves as Elsa 's assistant . She is seen playing a miniature violin of sorts and also serves as Elsa 's manicurist and `` cuddle '' toy in the later hours . She was born with achondroplasia which results in an extremely short stature , and is thus deemed the world 's shortest woman . Seen as the baby of the troupe , Ma Petite 's sweet nature and naive innocence leads her to trust almost everyone , with ultimately tragic consequences . Maggie lures her away one night attempts to murder her in `` Bullseye '' for Stanley , but ca n't force herself to go through with it . In `` Test of Strength '' , Dell , under the pretense of gifting her with a new dress , hugs her and then squeezes until her spine snaps and she dies . He gives her body to Stanley and it is later seen being presented by Lillian in her Museum of Morbid Curiosities in a jar of formaldehyde , where her birth name is revealed . The carnies later find her bloody dress in an area full of unidentified bones , and believe that she has been eaten by a wild animal . She later appears to Dell in a hallucination before he attempts suicide by hanging . She and the other freaks appear when Elsa joins the freak show in the afterlife , where Ma Petite once again helps Elsa to get ready for her performance .   Lillian Hemmings ( portrayed by Celia Weston ) is the curator of the Museum of Morbid Curiosities ; she collects and buys strange artifacts for her museum . She catches Stanley and Maggie 's fraudulence but says if she is offered something of real worth from a freak show , she will pay big money . Stanley regularly imagines scenarios with her presenting him with money and acclaim for his finds . In `` Test of Strength '' , she unveils her new exhibit to various wealthy people of Ma Petite 's dead body ( presented as Mahadevi Patel , the world 's smallest woman ) , floating in a jar of what is assumed to be formaldehyde .

{"question":"name the cell which is attached to the lateral side of sieve tube","short_answers":["sieve tube elements"],"long_answer":" In plant anatomy , sieve tube elements , also called sieve tube members , are highly specialised type of elongated cell in the phloem tissue of flowering plants . The ends of these cells are connected with other sieve tube members , and together they constitute the sieve tube . The main function of the sieve tube is transport of carbohydrates , primarily sucrose , in the plant ( e.g. , from the leaves to the fruits and roots ) . Unlike the water - conducting xylem vessel elements that are dead when mature , sieve elements are living cells . They are unique in lacking a nucleus at maturity . ","category":"fully specified","judgment":"fully specified","reasoning":"This question is fully specified because it refers to a well-defined biological structure (sieve tube) and asks for the specific cell type attached to its lateral side. The term \"companion cell\" is the standard anatomical term for this relationship in plant vascular systems. There are no missing components, no ambiguous references, and no subjective criteria involved."}
{"question":"who wrote the song if i were a boy","short_answers":["BC Jean and Toby Gad"],"long_answer":" `` If I Were a Boy '' is a song performed by American singer and songwriter Beyonc\u00e9 from her third studio album I Am ... Sasha Fierce ( 2008 ) . It was written by BC Jean and Toby Gad , who also handled its production alongside Beyonc\u00e9 . Inspired by the difficult break - up of a romantic relationship , the song was initially recorded by Jean , whose record company rejected it . Beyonc\u00e9 then recorded her own version . Jean was upset when she learned that Beyonc\u00e9 was releasing it as a single , but eventually , they reached an agreement . Columbia Records released `` If I Were a Boy '' to US radio on October 8 , 2008 , as a double A-side single album 's alongside `` Single Ladies ( Put a Ring on It ) '' as the lead singles . The two songs showcased the contrast between Beyonc\u00e9 's personality and her aggressive onstage persona , Sasha Fierce . A Spanish version of the song , titled `` Si Yo Fuera un Chico '' , was digitally released in Mexico and Spain . ","category":"fully specified","judgment":"fully specified","reasoning":"This question is fully specified because it refers to a specific song title (\"If I Were a Boy\") and asks for the factual identity of the songwriter.

With their equipment out of fuel , Armin devises another plan . The survivors draw the Titans ' attention to an elevator and shoot them in the eyes to blind them , while seven of them jump from the ceiling to finish them off .

When Eren was eaten and swallowed by the Bearded Titan , he found himself in its stomach along with the bodies of its victims . His rage at the Titans caused him to burst out of the Bearded Titan 's stomach by transforming himself into the Mysterious Titan and going on a rampage against them . Although Eren 's comrades saw him emerge from the Mysterious Titan , they all agreed to keep it a secret and bring him back inside Wall Rose . However , Kitts also witnessed this and has his men aim their weapons at Eren . Armin and Mikasa try to defend Eren , but to no avail .

Eren comes up with two plans of escape . The first is for Eren to retreat as the Mysterious Titan and criminalize himself in the eyes of humanity , and the second is to have Armin convince Kitts that Eren is an asset rather than a danger . Armin comes to the conclusion that he can still defend his friends despite being cowardice , deciding to try and talk their way out of being executed . Armin tentatively convinces Kitts , only to have him be overcome by fear and give the order to fire once more . The order is halted when Commander Dot Pyxis and his men intervene , sparing their lives . In return , Pyxis asks Eren if he will transform himself to block the gap in Wall Rose to prevent more Titans from getting in .

Claiming that Eren is the result of a secret project to turn humans into Titans , Pyxis plans to have most of the troops gather at a far corner of the Trost District to lure most of the Titans away while Eren as the Mysterious Titan carries the giant boulder to seal the hole . Along with Mikasa , Eren will be guarded during the mission by three of the best elites of the Garrison , them being Ian Dietrich , Rico Brzenska and Mitabi Jarnach .

{"question":"1. what was the precursor to the present day internet","short_answers":["The Internet protocol suite (TCP\/IP)"],"long_answer":" The Internet protocol suite ( TCP \/ IP ) was developed by Robert E. Kahn and Vint Cerf in the 1970s and became the standard networking protocol on the ARPANET , incorporating concepts from the French CYCLADES project directed by Louis Pouzin . In the early 1980s the NSF funded the establishment for national supercomputing centers at several universities , and provided interconnectivity in 1986 with the NSFNET project , which also created network access to the supercomputer sites in the United States from research and education organizations . Commercial Internet service providers ( ISPs ) began to emerge in the very late 1980s . The ARPANET was decommissioned in 1990 . Limited private connections to parts of the Internet by officially commercial entities emerged in several American cities by late 1989 and 1990 , and the NSFNET was decommissioned in 1995 , removing the last restrictions on the use of the Internet to carry commercial traffic .

{"question":"today gestalt psychology ideas are part of which branch of psychology","short_answers":["Berlin School of experimental psychology"],"long_answer":" Gestalt psychology or gestaltism ( German : Gestalt ( \u0261\u0259\u02c8\u0283talt ) `` shape , form '' ) is a philosophy of mind of the Berlin School of experimental psychology . Gestalt psychology is an attempt to understand the laws behind the ability to acquire and maintain meaningful perceptions in an apparently chaotic world . The central principle of gestalt psychology is that the mind forms a global whole with self - organizing tendencies . The assumed physiological mechanisms on which Gestalt theory rests are poorly defined and support for their existence is lacking . The Gestalt theory of perception has been criticized as being descriptive of the end products of perception without providing much insight into the processes that lead to perception . In the introduction to a 2016 special issue of the journal Vision Research on Gestalt perception , the authors concluded that `` even though they study the same phenomena as earlier Gestaltists , there is little theoretical coherence . What happened to the Gestalt school that always aspired to provide a unified vision of psychology ? Perhaps there is , in fact , little that holds the classic phenomena of Gestalt psychology together .

{"question":"who is responsible for introducing the principle of uniformitarianism","short_answers":["geologist James Hutton"],"long_answer":" In geology , uniformitarianism has included the gradualistic concept that `` the present is the key to the past '' ( that events occur at the same rate now as they have always done ) ; many geologists now , however , no longer hold to a strict theory of gradualism . Coined by William Whewell , the word was proposed in contrast to catastrophism by British naturalists in the late 18th century , starting with the work of the geologist James Hutton .

She has two children with Deacon . Kelly and Deacon experience some serious relationship problems , much more serious than the petty arguments between Doug and Carrie . On one occasion , Deacon mentions being hit in the head with a frying pan . She was absent from the show in 2002 because she needed to take a break from the series ; during this period , her character was estranged from Deacon and engaged in a brief affair .   Lou Ferrigno ( seasons 3 -- 9 ; himself ) is the actor known for his role as The Incredible Hulk . Ferrigno and his wife are neighbors of the Heffernans . A running gag on the series is that the neighbors ( including the Heffernans ) are fascinated by him and it gets on his nerves . Lou does not like people telling him Hulk jokes . Other characters often make reference to his previous role as the Hulk . For example , at one point Doug is angry and Lou tries to calm him down ; Doug retorts with the famous line from the Hulk series `` Do n't make me angry ; you would n't like me when I am angry '' . Also , in the episode `` Gym Neighbors '' , it is revealed that he has a video game addiction .   Supervisor Patrick O'Boyle ( seasons 3 -- 9 ; played by Sam McMurray ) is section supervisor for the fictional International Parcel Service .

O'Donohue ) appears in an episode from season one ( `` White Collar '' , 1999 ) .   Raymond `` Ray '' Barone ( seasons 1 , 2 & 8 ; 5 episodes ; played by Ray Romano ) is Doug 's Long Island friend . Romano and James appearing on each other 's shows was part of a network program crossover , as CBS aired both Everybody Loves Raymond and The King of Queens . Romano 's appearance was successful enough to warrant all other lead characters ( Patricia Heaton , Brad Garrett , Doris Roberts , and Peter Boyle ) to appear as their respective characters as well . Appropriately , the four episodes featuring Romano contained `` Ray '' in their titles ( `` Road Rayge '' , `` Rayny Day '' , `` Dire Strayts '' , and `` Raygin ' Bulls '' ) .   Doug Pruzan ( season 2 -- 6 ; played by Alex Skuby ) is Carrie 's boss and a lawyer at a Manhattan law firm .   Veronica Olchin ( season 1 ; played by Grace Zabriskie , seasons 5 -- 9 played by Anne Meara ) Spence 's mother . She is portrayed by Zabriske in her first appearance in `` S'aint Valentines '' , but portrayed by Meara for the rest of the series . Veronica has an on - again \/ off - again relationship with Arthur , who is portrayed by Meara 's real - life husband , Jerry Stiller .

{"question":"who is recognized as the founder of islam","short_answers":["Muhammad"],"long_answer":" According to tradition , the Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca around the year 570 . His family belonged to the Quraysh . When he was about forty years old , he began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations delivered through the angel Gabriel , which would later form the Quran , enjoining him to proclaim a strict monotheistic faith , warn his compatriots of the impending Judgement Day , and castigate social injustices of his city . Muhammad 's message won over a handful of followers and was met with increasing opposition from notables of Mecca . In 618 , after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle Abu Talib , Muhammad took flight to the city of Yathrib ( subsequently called Medina ) where he was joined by his followers . Later generations would count this event , known as the hijra , as the start of the Islamic era .

{"question":"what is the role of anaerobic respiration in living things","short_answers":["ATP synthesis from ADP and inorganic phosphate"],"long_answer":" Cellular respiration ( both aerobic and anaerobic ) utilizes highly reduced chemical compounds such as NADH and FADH2 ( for example produced during glycolysis and the citric acid cycle ) to establish an electrochemical gradient ( often a proton gradient ) across a membrane , resulting in an electrical potential or ion concentration difference across the membrane . The reduced chemical compounds are oxidized by a series of respiratory integral membrane proteins with sequentially increasing reduction potentials with the final electron acceptor being oxygen ( in aerobic respiration ) or another chemical substance ( in anaerobic respiration ) . A proton motive force drives protons down the gradient ( across the membrane ) through the proton channel of ATP synthase . The resulting current drives ATP synthesis from ADP and inorganic phosphate .

{"question":"what percentage of sunlight is captured by plants to convert it into food energy","short_answers":["3 to 6%"],"long_answer":" where C H O is glucose ( which is subsequently transformed into other sugars , cellulose , lignin , and so forth ) . The value of the photosynthetic efficiency is dependent on how light energy is defined -- it depends on whether we count only the light that is absorbed , and on what kind of light is used ( see Photosynthetically active radiation ) . It takes eight ( or perhaps 10 or more ) photons to utilize one molecule of CO . The Gibbs free energy for converting a mole of CO to glucose is 114 kcal , whereas eight moles of photons of wavelength 600 nm contains 381 kcal , giving a nominal efficiency of 30 % . However , photosynthesis can occur with light up to wavelength 720 nm so long as there is also light at wavelengths below 680 nm to keep Photosystem II operating ( see Chlorophyll ) . Using longer wavelengths means less light energy is needed for the same number of photons and therefore for the same amount of photosynthesis . For actual sunlight , where only 45 % of the light is in the photosynthetically active wavelength range , the theoretical maximum efficiency of solar energy conversion is approximately 11 % . In actuality , however , plants do not absorb all incoming sunlight ( due to reflection , respiration requirements of photosynthesis and the need for optimal solar radiation levels ) and do not convert all harvested energy into biomass , which results in an overall photosynthetic efficiency of 3 to 6 % of total solar radiation . If photosynthesis is inefficient , excess light energy must be dissipated to avoid damaging the photosynthetic apparatus . Energy can be dissipated as heat ( non-photochemical quenching ) , or emitted as chlorophyll fluorescence . ","category":"fully specified","judgment":"fully specified","reasoning":"This question is fully specified because it asks for a well-documented scientific fact: the general efficiency of photosynthesis in converting sunlight into chemical energy. The referent is clear, the scope is factual, and the answer is a widely accepted statistic (approximately 3-6% for most plants).

{"question":"when was the taming ofthe shrew first performed","short_answers":["prior to June 1592"],"long_answer":" However , it is possible to narrow the date further . A terminus ante quem for A Shrew seems to be August 1592 , as a stage direction at 3.21 mentions `` Simon , '' which probably refers to the actor Simon Jewell , who was buried on 21 August 1592 . Furthermore , The Shrew must have been written earlier than 1593 , as Anthony Chute 's Beauty Dishonoured , written under the title of Shore 's wife ( published in June 1593 ) contains the line `` He calls his Kate , and she must come and kiss him . '' This must refer to The Shrew , as there is no corresponding `` kissing scene '' in A Shrew . There are also verbal similarities between both Shrew plays and the anonymous play A Knack to Know a Knave ( first performed at The Rose on 10 June 1592 ) . Knack features several passages common to both A Shrew and The Shrew , but it also borrows several passages unique to The Shrew . This suggests The Shrew was on stage prior to June 1592 .

{"question":"when did indoor toilets become common in america","short_answers":["After World War I"],"long_answer":" Indoor toilets were at first a luxury of the rich and only gradually spread to the lower classes . As late as the 1890s , building regulations in London did not require working - class housing to have indoor toilets ; into the early 20th century , some English homes were built with an upstairs toilet for use by the owners and an outhouse for use by the servants .

{"question":"when was kudzu introduced to the united states","short_answers":["1876"],"long_answer":" The kudzu plant was introduced to the United States from Japan in 1876 at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia . Kudzu was introduced to the Southeast in 1883 at the New Orleans Exposition . The vine was widely marketed in the Southeast as an ornamental plant to be used to shade porches , and in the first half of the 20th century , kudzu was distributed as a high - protein content cattle fodder and as a cover plant to prevent soil erosion . It was cultivated by Civilian Conservation Corps workers as a solution for the erosion during the Dust Bowl . The Soil Erosion Service recommended the use of kudzu to help control erosion of slopes which led to the government - aided distribution of 85 million seedlings and government - funded plantings of kudzu which paid $19.75 per hectare . By 1946 , it was estimated that 1,200,000 hectares ( 3,000,000 acres ) of kudzu had been planted . When boll weevil infestations and the failure of cotton crops caused farmers to abandon their farms , kudzu plantings were left unattended . The climate and environment of the Southeastern United States allowed the kudzu to grow virtually unchecked . In 1953 the United States Department of Agriculture removed kudzu from a list of suggested cover plants and listed it as a weed in 1970 . By 1997 , the vine was placed on the `` Federal Noxious Weed List '' . Today , kudzu is estimated to cover 3,000,000 hectares ( 7,400,000 acres ) of land in the southeastern United States , mostly in Alabama , Georgia , Tennessee , Florida , North Carolina , South Carolina and Mississippi . It has been recorded in Nova Scotia , Canada , in Columbus , Ohio , and in all five boroughs of New York City .

{"question":"who developed the central processing unit (cpu)","short_answers":["John von Neumann"],"long_answer":" The idea of a stored - program computer was already present in the design of J. Presper Eckert and John William Mauchly 's ENIAC , but was initially omitted so that it could be finished sooner . On June 30 , 1945 , before ENIAC was made , mathematician John von Neumann distributed the paper entitled First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC . It was the outline of a stored - program computer that would eventually be completed in August 1949 . EDVAC was designed to perform a certain number of instructions ( or operations ) of various types . Significantly , the programs written for EDVAC were to be stored in high - speed computer memory rather than specified by the physical wiring of the computer . This overcame a severe limitation of ENIAC , which was the considerable time and effort required to reconfigure the computer to perform a new task . With von Neumann 's design , the program that EDVAC ran could be changed simply by changing the contents of the memory . EDVAC , however , was not the first stored - program computer ; the Manchester Small - Scale Experimental Machine , a small prototype stored - program computer , ran its first program on 21 June 1948 and the Manchester Mark 1 ran its first program during the night of 16 -- 17 June 1949 .

In that case , the play will be scored both as a hit ( for the number of bases the fielders should have limited the batter to ) and an error . However , if a batter is judged to have reached base solely because of a fielder 's mistake , it is scored as a `` hit on error , '' and treated the same as if the batter had been put out , hence lowering his batting average . ","category":"fully specified","judgment":"fully specified","reasoning":"This question is fully specified because it asks for a clear, factual baseball rule: whether a batter's action of reaching base on an error (e.g., a fielder's choice or an error allowing a runner to advance) counts as an at-bat. The definition of an at-bat in baseball is well-established, and the scenario described is unambiguous. There are no missing components, no referential ambiguity, and no subjective standards involved."}
{"question":"what is the point in a rugby scrum","short_answers":["restarting play after a minor infringement"],"long_answer":" In rugby union a scrum is a means of restarting play after a minor infringement . It involves up to eight players from each team , known as the pack or forward pack , binding together in three rows and interlocking with the free opposing teams forwards . At this point the ball is fed into the gap between the two forward packs and they both compete for the ball to win possession . Teams can be penalised for intentionally causing the scrum to collapse , and for not putting the ball into the scrum correctly . A scrum is most commonly awarded when the ball is knocked forward , or passed forward , or when a ball becomes trapped in a ruck or maul . Because of the physical nature of scrums , injuries can occur , especially in the front row . ","category":"fully specified","judgment":"fully specified","reasoning":"This question is fully specified because it asks for the primary objective of a rugby scrum, which is a well-defined aspect of the sport. The term \"point\" here refers to the purpose or goal of the scrum, which is to gain possession of the ball and advance it toward the opposing team's try zone.

The concept applies to E1s as well and both can include more than 2 PRIs .

{"question":"when did the first train run in england","short_answers":["1560s"],"long_answer":" The railway system of Great Britain , the principal territory of the United Kingdom , is the oldest in the world . It was started with the building of local isolated wooden wagonways starting in 1560s . The system was later built as a patchwork of local rail links operated by small private railway companies in late 18th century . These isolated links developed during the railway boom of the 1840s into a national network , although still run by dozens of competing companies . Over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries , these amalgamated or were bought by competitors until only a handful of larger companies remained ( see railway mania ) . The entire network was brought under government control during the First World War and a number of advantages of amalgamation and planning were revealed . However , the government resisted calls for the nationalisation of the network . In 1923 , almost all the remaining companies were grouped into the `` big four '' , the Great Western Railway , the London and North Eastern Railway , the London , Midland and Scottish Railway and the Southern Railway . The `` Big Four '' were joint - stock public companies and they continued to run the railway system until 31 December 1947 .

{"question":"who was the first imperial power that was fighting in vietnam","short_answers":["France"],"long_answer":" Full - scale war broke out between the Vi\u1ec7t Minh and France in late 1946 and the First Indochina War officially began . Realizing that colonialism was coming to an end worldwide , France decided to bring former emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i back to power , as a political alternative to Ho Chi Minh . A Provisional Central Government was formed in 1948 , reuniting Annam and Tonkin , but the complete reunification of Vietnam was delayed for a year because of the problems posed by Cochinchina 's legal status . In July 1949 , the State of Vietnam was officially proclaimed , as a semi-independent country within the French Union , with B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i as Head of State . France was finally persuaded to relinquish its colonies in Indochina in 1954 when Viet Minh forces defeated the French at Dien Bien Phu . The 1954 Geneva Conference left Vietnam a divided nation , with H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh 's communist DRV government ruling the North from Hanoi and Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m 's Republic of Vietnam , supported by the United States , ruling the South from Saigon . Between 1953 and 1956 , the North Vietnamese government instituted various agrarian reforms , including `` rent reduction '' and `` land reform '' , which resulted in significant political oppression . During the land reform , testimony from North Vietnamese witnesses suggested a ratio of one execution for every 160 village residents , which extrapolated nationwide would indicate nearly 100,000 executions . Because the campaign was concentrated mainly in the Red River Delta area , a lower estimate of 50,000 executions became widely accepted by scholars at the time . However , declassified documents from the Vietnamese and Hungarian archives indicate that the number of executions was much lower than reported at the time , although likely greater than 13,500 . In the South , Diem went about crushing political and religious opposition , imprisoning or killing tens of thousands .

It is a place of `` infinite nothingness '' , where the competitors can fight without limits . The tournament champion will be granted a wish by the Super Dragon Balls , while the losers and their respective universes will be completely erased from existence . Everyone is horrified by this harsh penalty . Goku suggests asking Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d to ignore it , but Whis advises against this . Whis tells Goku that Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d has already made up his mind and attempting to change it could be dangerous . Beerus demands that Goku takes responsibility for asking Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d to hold the tournament in the first place .

Back at Grand Zen\u014d 's and Future Grand Zen\u014d 's palace , all the gods from all 12 universes gather . The Grand Minister explains the purpose of the Zen Exhibition Match . He alludes to the possibility of Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d erasing the fighters that he deems unfit for the tournament . In the first round , Majin Buu is to fight Basil ( \u30d0\u30b8\u30eb , Bajiru ) , a humanoid canine fighter from Universe 9 .     79     `` Universe 9 's Basil the Kicker VS Universe 7 's Majin Buu ! !

Goku goads Basil into showing his full power to get Majin Buu 's attention , which leads to Basil using his ultimate attack . As Roh ( \u30ed\u30a6 , R\u014d ) , the Supreme Kai of Universe 9 , claims victory , Majin Buu emerges with a hole in his stomach , but he is otherwise unmoved . Basil and Roh are shocked to see this . Mr. Satan is injured during the attack . He tells Majin Buu to beat Basil before falling unconscious . This enrages Majin Buu to the point , where he effortlessly beats Basil and knocks him out of the ring . However , since neither Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d is satisfied with the fight , Basil is allowed to get back into the ring . Roh gives Basil a drug that makes him far more powerful . Although Beerus demands that Basil is disqualified for obvious cheating , Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d is entertained by this and allows the fight to continue . The Grand Minister announces that the rules will be improvised as the tournament goes along . Basil overpowers Majin Buu and seemingly beats him , which causes Roh to prematurely gloat about the superiority of Universe 9 . However , Majin Buu emerges unscathed and launches a full power attack at Basil . This knocks him out and clinches Universe 7 the victory .

Shin offers Gohan a Senzu bean to cure the poison , but Gohan refuses and says he wants to fight with his strength alone . Unable to see , Gohan uses his other senses to track Lavender and scores several blows . Lavender counters by levitating , which eliminates the sound of his footsteps . Gohan responds by powering up to Super Saiyan and bouncing his own ki off of Lavender 's body , which uses it as a kind of active radar . Powering up also causes the poison to spread rapidly through Gohan 's body . Lavender mounts a comeback . In desperation , Gohan grabs hold of Lavender and launches a kamikaze attack . He drives both of their bodies into the ring at high speed . Lavender is knocked out , but Gohan is so weakened by the poison that he can not continue . With both fighters down , the match is declared a tie . After Goku feeds Gohan a Senzu bean , the Grand Minister announces to those in attendance that all universes that lose the Tournament of Power will be erased with their respective gods as well . However , Universes 1 , 5 , 8 , and 12 will be exempt from erasure as will the Angels from all universes because their inhabitants are particularly strong . Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d had long believed that there were too many universes . He was planning to erase most of them anyway , but the tournament will afford one of the weaker universes the chance to be spared . With the announcement concluded , the ring is repaired in preparation for the final exhibition match where Goku will fight Bergamo ( \u30d9\u30eb\u30ac\u30e2 , Berugamo ) , Basil 's oldest brother who is also a humanoid canine .     81   5   `` Bergamo the Crusher Vs Son Goku !

Grand Minister states that if Goku holds back to cancel the erasure , Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d will immediately erase all of the universes . Both Goku and Bergamo agree to the terms . When the fight begins , Bergamo invites Goku to hit him and leaves himself exposed . Goku obliges and strikes Bergamo several times , but Bergamo absorbs the energy of Goku 's attacks . He grows stronger and physically larger . Goku continues to attack , which causes Bergamo to grow so large that the ring begins to buckle under his weight . Goku transforms to Super Saiyan Blue , which shocks the gods and quickly overwhelms Bergamo with a Kaioken powered Kamehameha . Bergamo claims every universe participating in the Tournament of Power will seek vengeance on Goku for making them face erasure , but Goku relishes the idea of such a challenge . The Zen Exhibition Match comes to a close and the Tournament of Power will soon begin . The universe with the most fighters remaining or the last fighter standing will be declared the winner . Suddenly , a mysterious fighter from Universe 11 named Toppo ( \u30c8\u30c3\u30dd ) appears and challenges Goku to a battle .
