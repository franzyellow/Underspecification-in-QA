54,"I'm hosting a vegan dinner party this weekend, can you suggest a three-course meal with recipes?",underspecified,IN3,Undetermined standard or preference,"The request is underspecified because it does not clarify the number of guests to be served, leaving the portioning standard open. It also lacks preference details such as the type of cuisine (e.g., Italian, Asian-fusion) or the desired difficulty level of the recipes (e.g., simple, advanced). These are all essential for tailoring the three-course meal suggestion accurately, but they are lacking. Therefore, the request is underspecified.","The task of suggesting a three-course vegan meal with recipes for a dinner party is somewhat clear, but there are still some important details missing.
